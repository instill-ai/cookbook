# ðŸ“” Instill AI Cookbook

A collection of notebooks and guides that showcase some of the many AI solutions you can build with **[Instill Core](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core)** and **[Instill Cloud](https://instill.tech/hub)**.

To execute these examples, youâ€™ll need an **Instill Cloud** account along with an Instill API Token. To set up your account, please refer to our [quickstart guide](https://www.instill.tech/docs/quickstart). For generating your API Token, consult the [API Token Management](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core/token) page. We suggest configuring your API token as an environment variable with the following command:
```bash
export INSTILL_API_TOKEN=********
```
Or, you can make a `.env` file at the root of your repository with the content
`INSTILL_API_TOKEN=********`.

## Notebooks

Explore the following example notebooks and learn how our full-stack AI infrastructure can help you build and deploy real-world production-grade AI applications from the comfort of a Jupyter Notebook.
