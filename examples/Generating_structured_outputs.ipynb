    "# Generating Structured Output from LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the performance of OpenAI's new [Structured Outputs in the\n",
    "API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) feature, alongside multiple existing tools for generating structured outputs from LLMs. As well as providing a concise demonstration of how to use all of these tools, we will also evaluate them with respect to a task that involves both **reasoning** and **structuring outputs**, inspired by the recent publication titled [Let Me Speak Freely? A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442v1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This illuminates an important problem raised in the paper: **LLMs struggle with reasoning tasks when they're placed under format restrictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides OpenAI's new structured outputs in the API, the existing tools and libraries that we will demonstrate and test are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Instructor**](https://python.useinstructor.com) - a Python library, built on top of Pydantic, that lets you generate structured output from LLMs\n",
    "2. [**Marvin**](https://www.askmarvin.ai) - a Python library for building reliable natural language interfaces\n",
    "3. [**BAML**](https://www.boundaryml.com) - a domain specific language to write and test LLM functions\n",
    "4. [**TypeChat**](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/) - a tool from Microsoft for getting well-typed responses from language models\n",
    "5. [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) - a Python library that simplifies building apps with language models by integrating them with data and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "[Outlines](https://outlines-dev.github.io/outlines/), [JSONformer](https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer) and [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance/tree/main) were also considered, however they were left out of this experiment as they had limited support for remote API calls and failed when integrating with the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will demonstrate a multi-step approach using Instill VDP, where we separate reasoning from output structuring in a two-step process that allows us to achieve strong reasoning performance from LLMs whilst also producing robust structured outputs."

    "To execute all of the code in this notebook, you’ll need to create a free Instill Cloud account and setup an API Token. To create your account, please refer to our [quickstart guide](https://www.instill.tech/docs/quickstart). For generating your API Token, consult the [API Token Management](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core/token) page.\n",

    "Whilst you can run all Instill VDP pipelines using your 10,000 free monthly credits, please note that you will need a valid OpenAI API key to run the structured LLM output evaluations (e.g. for Instructor, Marvin, BAML, TypeChat). Once you have created one via the OpenAI website, please set it as an environment variable by running the following line, but replacing `*********` for your OpenAI API key."

    "\n",
    "This problem is easily solved using an Instill VDP pipeline that separates reasoning and structuring tasks into a two-step process. It first generates an unstructured reasoning response which is then passed to a second component which is solely responsible for structuring the reasoning response into the desired data model. The final output is delivered as a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please view and explore the components and structure of the [`multistep-structured-output`](https://instill.tech/george_strong/pipelines/multistep-structured-output/playground) pipeline in the no-code editor window shown below. Note that you can expand the components in the pipeline by selecting the `+` icon."

    "### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Structured Outputs in the API [release post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), OpenAI suggested that using reasoning chain-of-thought prompting via the data model/schema. In other words, defining a field in the schema called `reasoning_steps`, where the model is requested to share its reasoning, and then take the final calculated answer and place it in the `cost` field. The [`structured-output-reasoning-cot`](https://instill.tech/george_strong/pipelines/structured-output-reasoning-cot/playground) pipeline implements this and is demonstrated in the below cell. As can be observed, its performance still suffers in a similar manner to the standard [`structured-output`](https://instill.tech/george_strong/pipelines/structured-output/playground) pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, in the particular inference example shown below, even though the reasoning was correct, the model was still unable to correctly populate the `cost` field!"
