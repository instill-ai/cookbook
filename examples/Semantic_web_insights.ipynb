    "# Semantic Web Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will leverage our [Web Operator](https://www.instill.tech/docs/component/operator/web) component to generate high-quality Markdown from a website. We will then use the **Chunk Text** feature of our [Text Operator](https://www.instill.tech/docs/component/operator/text) to break the generated Markdown into manageable pieces, followed by embedding those chunks using the **[Jina CLIP V1](https://instill.tech/instill-ai/models/jina-clip-v1/playground?version=v0.1.0)** model served via [Instill Model](https://www.instill.tech/docs/model/introduction). Finally, we will perform downstream analysis and visualization of the rich semantic information captured in the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to extract meaningful insights from web content is crucial for developing AI and ML applications. By converting web pages into structured Markdown format, we can maintain essential formatting while enabling AI models to process and understand the information efficiently. This structured approach allows for improved data handling, analysis, and semantic search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workflow consists of the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crawl a Website** using the [**website-to-markdown**](https://instill.tech/george_strong/pipelines/website-to-markdown/playground) pipeline to generate high-quality Markdown content.\n",
    "2. **Chunk the Markdown** using the [**chunk-text-array**](https://instill.tech/george_strong/pipelines/chunk-text-array/playground) pipeline, allowing for custom strategy to enhance manageability and semantic relevance.\n",
    "3. **Embed the Chunks** with Jina CLIP V1 to create semantic representations.\n",
    "4. **Perform Clustering and Visualization** to analyze the relationships and distributions of the embeddings.\n"

You might also hear the doctor call it arrhythmia.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### The Costs of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)\\n\\nIf you have AFib, treating it cuts your risk of having a stroke. But it can be costly, even if you have insurance.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### Latest Research on Atrial Fibrillation\\n\\nToday, researchers are still hard at work on finding ways to treat, manage, and prevent AFib and its complications.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### Which Type of Atrial Fibrillation Do You Have?\\n\\nAFib doesn\\u2019t so much have types as it has durations. Doctors classify it by how long it lasts, or what causes it.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### Causes, Risk Factors, and Triggers\\n\\nThe basic cause of AFib is disorganized signals that make your heart's two upper chambers squeeze very fast and out of sync.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### AFib and Diabetes: What\\u2019s the Link?\\n\\nStudies have found that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes likely raise your risk of developing AFib.\",\"# Atrial Fibrillation Resource Center\\n### What's the Link Between AFib and Thyroid Disease?\\n\\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, you have a much higher chance of getting AFib.

But a drug can bring on problems if it doesn't mix well with something else you put into your body, like another medication, a certain food, or [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts).\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Drug Interactions?\\n\\nWhen that happens, it's called a [drug interaction](https://www.webmd.com/interaction-checker/default.htm). It could make your medication stop working, become less effective, or too strong. It could also trigger side effects.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Drug Interactions?\\n\\nThe more you learn about drug interactions, the better you'll be able to avoid them. Here's what you need to know.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are the 3 Types of Drug Interactions?\\n\\nThe main types are:\",\"\\n**Drug-drug interaction**. This is when a medication reacts with one or more other drugs. For example, taking a [cough medicine](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cough-syrup-cough-medicine) ( [antitussive](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-54333-antitussive+oral.aspx)) and a drug to help you [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm) (sedative) could cause the two medications to affect each other.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Drug-food/drink interaction**. This is when something you eat or drink affects a drug. For instance, it can be dangerous to drink alcohol while you're on certain medications. Some [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) and [dietary supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-faq) interact with medicines, too.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Drug-condition interaction**. This is when you have a health problem that makes it risky for you to take certain meds. For example, if you have a condition like [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm), taking a [decongestant](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) for a [cold](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm) could drive up your [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers) even more.\\n\\n\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Drugs Can You Not Take Together?\\n\\nThere are many types of drugs you shouldn't take together, but in general, don't take combinations like these:\",\"\\n**Two or more drugs that share an active ingredient.** You could have side effects or an [overdose](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/drug-overdose). Active ingredients are the chemicals in medications that treat your condition or symptoms. Always check for them on the drug label.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Blood-thinning drugs with [NSAIDs](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/features/pain-relief-how-nsaids-work)**. Your odds for a dangerous bleed could go up. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are pain relievers like [ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9368-IBUPROFEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5166&drugname=ibuprofen+oral) or [naproxen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-1289-NAPROXEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5173&drugname=Naproxen+Oral). If you're on a blood thinner, ask your doctor to suggest a different type of over-the-counter pain medication and dose that's safer for you.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Pills with antihistamines.** Taking these together can cause you to react more slowly, which would make it dangerous for you to drive or work with heavy machines.\\n\\n\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Drugs Can You Not Take Together?\\n\\nSome other drug-drug combinations that can be dangerous are:\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Common Drug Interactions?\\n\\nCertain foods and drinks don't mix well with some medications. A few of these are:\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Common Drug Interactions?\\n\\nBefore you start a new medication, ask your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions) if it could interact with alcohol. Check the drug label for alcohol warnings, too.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Common Drug Interactions?\\n\\nGrapefruit juice doesn't mix badly with every type of drug in these classes of medications. Check your drug's label or information pamphlet for any warnings about it. Also, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it's safe to have grapefruit or its juice in any amount with your specific drug. If they tell you to stop eating or drinking it, ask if any other fruits or juices might have similar effects on your medicine.\",\"\\n**[Foods with vitamin K](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-vitamin-k)**, like leafy [greens](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-greens). These can interact with the [blood thinner](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ss/slideshow-tips-for-taking-blood-thinners) warfarin. You don't have to stop eating them, but it's important to be consistent and not overdo it. Ask your doctor how much food with vitamin K you can have, then eat the same amount around the same times each week.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**High- [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium) foods and drinks**, like bananas, salt substitutes, and orange juice. These can affect blood pressure drugs called [ACE inhibitors](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/medicine-ace-inhibitors). Your doctor will track your potassium levels, and they may tell you to cut back on foods with it.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**St. John's wort**. This herbal dietary supplement can affect many medications for heart disease, [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/default.htm), [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics), and other conditions. It can also affect [birth control pills](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills) and the [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm) drugs [irinotecan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-13700-irinotecan+iv.aspx) and [imatinib](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-20983-imatinib+oral.aspx).\\n\\n\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are Common Drug Interactions?\\n\\nAlways get your doctor's or pharmacist's OK before you try a new supplement. It's also possible for a medication you take to interact with a health condition you have. Some common drug-condition interactions happen between:\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### Is It OK to Take All Your Medications at Once?\\n\\nIt's important to take your medication as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. If two meds interact, spacing them apart during the day may not stop them from interacting and could lead to new or worse problems. To avoid an interaction, your doctor may need to change your dose or prescribe a different medication.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are the Symptoms of a Drug Interaction?\\n\\nThe symptoms of a drug interaction can vary a lot, depending on the drugs you\\u2019re taking and how they\\u2019re interacting. Sometimes you might not even know right away that an interaction is happening.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are the Symptoms of a Drug Interaction?\\n\\nIf you do notice an interaction, it will usually feel like one of these is happening:\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### What Are the Symptoms of a Drug Interaction?\\n\\nIn general, call your doctor if you're having side effects that worry you or if your medicine doesn't seem to be working, especially after you\\u2019ve recently started or changed doses of a drug.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?\\n\\nThere are several ways that drugs can interact with one another. Here are some examples of the most common ways.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?\\n\\nWhen two drugs can cause the same side effect and are used at the same time, they might cause more of that side effect. For example, if two drugs can each make you sleepy, taking them together can make you more or dangerously sleepy.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?\\n\\nWhen the unwanted effects of one drug are the opposite of the desired effects of another drug, you might end up with less of the desired effects. For example, taking one medication that raises blood pressure as an unwanted effect may decrease the benefits of taking another medication to lower your blood pressure.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?\\n\\nMost drugs that you swallow enter your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) through your [intestines](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-intestines). Sometimes a drug or supplement can block or trap another drug in the intestine before it can be absorbed. For example, supplements like [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details) and iron can prevent absorption of [thyroid](https://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-thyroid) meds.\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?\\n\\nYour body has enzymes, such as the cytochrome p450 (CYP) and others, that process many types of medications. This is called [metabolism](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/rm-quiz-truth-about-metabolism). It also has a way to get rid of drugs, usually though your [urine](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/truth-about-urine). Other drugs may speed up, slow down, or even completely block these functions. When this happens, the amount of drug in your body may increase (similar to taking too much) or decrease (similar to taking too little). Either way, this could cause serious problems.\",\"\\n**Work closely with your doctor.** Make sure they know all the medicines, vitamins, and supplements you're taking. That's extra important if you have more than one doctor who prescribes medicines for you. You could show them a list of the meds you're taking, or bring the medication packages to your appointment.\\n\\n\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do You Look for Drug Interactions?\\n\\nBefore you take a new drug, ask your doctor or pharmacist questions like:\",\"## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know\\n### How Do You Look for Drug Interactions?\\n\\nPharmacists are experts on medicine safety, and they can work with your doctors to help you avoid drug interactions. For example, if you have two doctors and they separately prescribe drugs that interact, your pharmacist can warn them -- and you -- before you have a problem.\",\"\\n**Read labels carefully.** Over-the-counter drug labels include information about possible drug interactions and the medication's active ingredients.

Just remember three simple words: [Wash your hands](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-prevention-hand-washing)!\",\"## How You Get Infected\\n\\nThe main way [colds](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-truth-common-cold) get passed around is when someone who's sick [coughs](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/coughs) or sneezes. Little droplets with germs land on places like doorknobs, telephones, and computer keyboards. Or the sick person [coughs](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cough-relief-12/slideshow-cough-treatments) or sneezes into their hands and then touches those objects.\",\"## How You Get Infected\\n\\nThen you come along, happy and healthy, and touch that spot. Next, without even realizing it, you might touch your nose and [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems). Voila! In an instant you're infected.\",\"## Why Hand Washing Works\\n\\nSome viruses -- tiny living things that cause [colds](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/video/myths-and-facts-about-colds) \\\\-\\\\- can live on surfaces for hours. Regular [hand washing](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/germs-at-school) is your best strategy to keep them from getting inside your body. And of course, if you're the one who's sick, washing up will keep you from spreading your germs.\",\"## Why Hand Washing Works\\n\\nThere's some evidence behind this. A program called Operation Stop [Cough](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-nighttime-cough) was started at a military recruit training command center in Illinois. As part of the program, recruits were told to wash their hands at least five times a day. After 2 years, the hand-washing team reported 45% fewer cases of respiratory illness, compared with sickness rates among recruits during the year before the program started.\",\"## How Should I Wash My Hands for Cold Prevention?\\n\\nMany of us get so busy, we simply forget to wash our hands the right way. Here's the drill:\",\"## How Much Hand Washing Is Enough to Prevent Colds?\\n\\nYou should wash hands often throughout the day. For example, do it before and after you eat, after using the bathroom, after school, and after handling any raw meat, unwashed vegetables, or garbage.\",\"## How Much Hand Washing Is Enough to Prevent Colds?\\n\\nAlso [wash your hands](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/dirty-truth-handwashing) after [coughing](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/treat-symptoms-12/video-how-to-calm-cough), [sneezing](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/features/11-surprising-sneezing-facts), blowing your nose, or touching your pet. If you're babysitting, wash before and after changing a baby's diapers and before and after feedings.\",\"## What if I'm Not Near a Sink?\\n\\nKeep an alcohol-based sanitizer for hands if a sink is unavailable. It should be at least 60% alcohol.\",\"## What if I'm Not Near a Sink?\\n\\nRub the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrist with the sanitizer until dry. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom. Follow up with a thorough hand scrub when you're near a sink to prevent buildup of the sanitizer.\",\"\\nYour food choices may help cut your odds of having [breast cancer](https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/understanding-breast-cancer-basics), though scientists are doing more research to learn how diet affects the disease. Focus on vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains, which should make up two-thirds of your plate. Reserve the other third for lean protein such as poultry or fish. More than 5 cups a day of plant-based fare is a good guideline.\",\"\\nIf you\\u2019re a woman who has two or three servings a day of wine, beer, or liquor, your risk is 20% higher than one who doesn\\u2019t drink at all. Experts say if you want to imbibe, have no more than one drink a day. That only slightly raises your chances of getting breast cancer.\",\"\\nTobacco use is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer, especially in younger women who haven\\u2019t gone through menopause. How much you smoke, the age when you started, and how long you continue all affect how likely you are to get the disease. If you\\u2019re a smoker, ask your health care provider about ways to help you quit.\",\"\\nThe makeup of all breasts is different. If yours have less fatty flesh and more milk glands and supportive tissue, they\\u2019re called \\u201cdense.\\u201d That can raise your breast cancer risk and make abnormal cells harder to spot on scans. Mammograms are one way to measure your tissue type. If you have dense breasts, take other steps to lower your odds for breast cancer. You may need to get screened more often or use more advanced screening tests.\",\"\\nRegular physical activity can lower your breast cancer risk. Experts say you should get either 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of harder, vigorous workouts over the course of a week. You can also do a bit of both.\",\"\\nWhen you eat a balanced diet and exercise, that can help you stay at a healthy weight, which also lowers your chance of breast cancer. Extra pounds, particularly if you put them on as an adult, are linked to a higher risk of the disease. That\\u2019s especially true for women who have been through menopause.\",\"\\nHormonal forms of contraception -- such as pills and some IUDs -- are linked to a slightly higher chance of breast cancer. But they can also protect you against other types of tumors. Your doctor can help you think about how the things that raise your odds of having breast cancer compare with the reliability and health benefits of different types of birth control and decide what\\u2019s best for you.\",\"\\nSome women take hormone replacement therapy to ease menopause symptoms or prevent bone fractures. But your risk of breast cancer rises when you take the combination type (estrogen and progesterone) or if you take the estrogen-only type for many years. If menopause seriously affects you, talk to your doctor about your options. If you decide to take this medication, you\\u2019ll want the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time.\",\"\\nYou can find this nutrient in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans. Women who eat plenty of these foods had a lower risk of breast cancer, according to several studies. Scientists aren\\u2019t exactly sure how it works to prevent tumors, but they\\u2019re doing more research to understand why. A fiber-rich diet can also help your health in other ways, like lowering your odds of diabetes and heart disease.\",\"\\nWomen exposed to a lot of light at night -- whether because they do shift work or they live in well-lit areas -- may have a higher risk of breast cancer. Researchers think the link is a hormone called melatonin, which your body makes when darkness falls so that you\\u2019ll feel sleepy. If you can, try to control how much light you\\u2019re around at night. Tools like blackout shades, a sleeping mask, and low-watt bulbs in your bathroom can help.\",\"\\nYour body makes its own vitamin D when sunlight hits your skin. But a more reliable way to get enough is through foods like salmon, oysters, sardines, and fortified foods like milk and orange juice. When you don\\u2019t get enough of this nutrient, your risk of breast cancer may go up. You can also get it in supplement form, but talk to your doctor before you take it.\",\"\\nMany cosmetics, lotions, and hair products have parabens, which can act like a weak estrogen in your body. Some scientists think these chemicals might be able to trigger hormone-positive breast cancer, but the research is far from clear. If you\\u2019re worried about the risk, you can buy items made without this substance.\",\"\\nThere\\u2019s a lot of misinformation about breast cancer out there. To address some common myths: A mammogram is an important screening tool, and it will not cause a tumor to spread. You will not raise your risk if you shave your underarms or use antiperspirant. Wearing a bra -- underwire or other types -- does not affect your odds.\",\"\\nBreastcancer.org: \\u201cCan Food Reduce Your Risk of Breast Cancer?\\u201d \\u201cSmoking,\\u201d \\u201cDense Breasts,\\u201d \\u201cUsing HRT,\\u201d \\u201cLight Exposure at Night,\\u201d \\u201cLow Vitamin D Levels,\\u201d \\u201cExposure to Chemicals in Plastic,\\u201d \\u201cExposure to Chemicals in Cosmetics,\\u201d \\u201cBreast Cancer Myths vs. Facts.\\u201d\",\"\\nAmerican Cancer Society: \\u201cFive Ways to Reduce Your Breast Cancer Risk,\\u201d \\u201cCan I Lower My Risk of Breast Cancer?\\u201d \\u201cAntiperspirants and Breast Cancer Risk.\\u201d\",\"\\nElderberry plants belong to the _Sambucus_ genus of flowering plants, and they're found all over the world.

They\\u2019re a popular addition to gardens with their pop of color, but many people also enjoy them in a freshly brewed cup of tea.\",\"\\nThe raw, unripe berries of the elderberry plant are actually poisonous, along with the leaves and stems. They contain the toxic substance sambunigrin. When sambunigrin is ingested, it degrades into hydrogen cyanide, which can be harmful.

Therefore, certain benefits may be associated with the drink. The bulk of the research for elderberries and elderberry tea focuses on their potential as a treatment for influenza.\",\"## Potential Health Benefits of Elderberry Tea\\n\\nSome research has shown that elderberries can help treat influenza and cold symptoms. Studies have shown that patients given elderberry extract commonly experience reduced duration and severity of influenza symptoms. However, there\\u2019s been no research specifically dedicated to the study of elderberry tea.\",\"## Potential Health Benefits of Elderberry Tea\\n\\nAnother study was conducted on a multi-ingredient hot drink that included both elderberry extract and _Echinacea purpurea_ root extract.

The skin around your eyes may also darken, and you may also get an extra fold of skin under your eye (called a Dennie-Morgan fold).

The best way to treat it will often depend on what triggers your flare-ups. Your doctor will work with you to figure them out so you can avoid your triggers. When you do have flare-ups, here are some ways your doctor may recommend to manage your symptoms:\",\"\\n**Apply steroid\\u00a0creams to your skin.** These are a key part of\\u00a0eczema treatment. Over-the-counter\\u00a0hydrocortisone\\u00a0cream can help with red,\\u00a0[itchy](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/why-so-itchy) skin. Put it on once or twice a day for several weeks. If that doesn\\u2019t work well enough, you may need a stronger prescription steroid. Use it only for a short time because it can thin your skin.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**If steroids don't work, try a calcineurin inhibitor**. Your doctor may prescribe these instead of a steroid cream. Calcineurin inhibitors block certain chemicals that can make your eczema flare. They\\u2019re used particularly to treat eczema on your face, especially your eyelids, neck, and skin folds.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Try phototherapy (ultraviolet light therapy).**\\u00a0This may help if your eczema is moderate to severe and cream\\u00a0medications\\u00a0haven\\u2019t worked. Keep in mind that using this type of treatment for a long time can raise your odds of\\u00a0getting skin cancer.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Take an antihistamine or immunosuppressant.** Your doctor may recommend you try an over-the-counter antihistamine to help reduce swelling and inflammation. If that doesn't work, they may prescribe an immunosuppressant to do the same thing.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Take an antifungal medicine if your eczema is caused by a fungus.**\\u00a0The overgrowth of one kind of yeast normally found on your skin can trigger an atopic eczema flare-up on your head or neck. A JAK inhibitor, [opzelura](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-182367/opzelura-topical/details) at 1.5 % can be used twice daily on people aged 12 and up.

For instance:\",\"\\n**Keep your skin moisturized.** Try using thick creams (such as Cetaphil or Eucerin) and ointments (such as Aquaphor or Vaseline) rather than thinner lotions. The best time to moisturize is right after you wash your face. If ointments are too greasy, try using them only at night. Also, choose moisturizers or lotions for gentle or sensitive skin. You're looking for moisturizers that don't have fragrances or dyes that can trigger an eczema flare.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Clean gently**. Soap can irritate your skin, but washing with water alone may not be enough, especially if your face is oily. Use a gentle non-soap cleanser or a medical emollient instead. Pat dry with a soft towel.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Watch the temperature.** Use only cool -- not hot -- water on your face, and for as little time as possible.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Skip makeup.** Don\\u2019t use cosmetics when you have a flare. The chemicals in makeup can irritate your skin further and prolong your flare-up.\\n\\n\",\"## Takeaways\\n\\nEczema is a group of skin conditions that makes your skin irritated, inflamed, and itchy. One of the common places to get a flare is on your face, especially on your cheeks. The best way to manage eczema on your face is to find out what triggers your flares and avoid contact with those triggers. But if you do have a flare, take good care of your skin by washing your face with gentle, non-soap cleanser and lukewarm water and using moisturizer several times a day. Your doctor may also suggest you try a steroid cream or prescribe a calcineurin inhibitor cream for rashes on your face.\",\"## Eczema on Face FAQs\\n\\nAccording to dermatologists, it's probably best to avoid cosmetics and skin care products that contain any of the following:\",\"## Eczema on Face FAQs\\n\\nFirst, read the label of your sunscreen carefully to make sure it doesn't contain any of your known allergens or eczema triggers. Next, look for an alcohol and fragrance-free sunscreen with a broad-spectrum sun protectant factor (SPF) of 30 or more. Finally, look for a mineral-based sunscreen that protects with either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.\",\"## Eczema on Face FAQs\\n\\nEmotional stress can be a trigger for many people with eczema. Some healthy ways of managing your stress include:\",\"## Eczema on Face FAQs\\n\\nAbout 30% of people with eczema, specifically atopic eczema, also have food allergies. The foods most likely to trigger a flare include dairy products, simple carbs, sugars, and processed foods.\",\"\\nOct. 15, 2024 \\u00ad-\\u00ad- When Sydney Stern bought an Apple Watch four years ago, she was excited to try out all the new features, especially the sleep tracker.\",\"\\nA health scientist, the 27-year-old Maryland [resident](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-resident-doctor) was well aware of the correlation between sleep and disease prevention. But what Stern thought would be a boon to her health became a harm, leading to [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/anxiety-disorders) and, in the end, less sleep.\",\"\\n\\u201cI was focused on getting seven hours of sleep every night because I knew there were diseases associated with fewer hours,\\u201d Stern said. \\u201cI was constantly checking the tracker, even at 4 in the morning, to see how I was doing.\\u201d\",\"\\n\\u201cI consciously take the watch off at night and even put it in a different room,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSince giving it up, the only measure I have of sleep is when I put my head down on the pillow and how I feel when I wake up.\\u201d\",\"\\nStern\\u2019s experience highlights a growing concern over the past several years as wearable sleep trackers have gained popularity. Sleep experts are seeing more \\u201c [orthosomnia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263088/)\\u201d among their patients \\u2014 an unofficial diagnosis describing hyper-fixation on perfect sleep.\",\"\\nPeople become overly focused on logging the right amount of not only total sleep but certain types of sleep, too. This can heighten anxiety and interfere with sleep \\u2014 paradoxically, making it harder to achieve restful slumber. Much of this fixation stems from the availability of data on their wrists, thanks to sleep trackers.\",\"\\n\\u201cI have patients who put 100 percent faith in their sleep trackers and if they don\\u2019t get the exact recommended numbers, they [worry](https://www.webmd.com/balance/how-worrying-affects-your-body) they\\u2019re harming their health,\\u201d said Robert Oexman, DC, chief science officer at mattress maker iSense. \\u201cThere can be any number of events leading to a poor night\\u2019s sleep, and if you\\u2019re already prone to perfectionism and anxiety, a sleep tracker will only compound that.\\u201d\",\"\\nOf course, the flipside of this trend is a crisis in sleep \\u201cself-regulation\\u201d \\u2014 trusting yourself (not technology) to know how well you\\u2019re sleeping and gauge your body\\u2019s needs. If you\\u2019re becoming fixated on sleep, it might be time to relearn this skill, just as Stern did.\",\"\\nModern sleep trackers gather a variety of data points, like your breathing rate, heart rate, and body movements. Putting it all together, the trackers then report how long you spent asleep, awake, and in different stages of sleep, like [deep sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101) and REM (rapid [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) movement) sleep.\",\"\\nBut what\\u2019s important to understand is that the trackers are built on averages and can report wrong information. \\u201cThe trackers do a decent job, but they often provide inaccurate measurements,\\u201d said Nicole Short, PhD, a clinical [psychologist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-psychologist) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \\u201cWe need to give context around the tracking.\\u201d\",\"\\nThat context includes the fact that brief wakeups throughout the night can be normal \\u2014 usually occurring when we shift from one sleep stage to the next \\u2014 and they don\\u2019t necessarily impact the quality or quantity of sleep. And the trackers use averages for their measurements when sleep needs are highly individualized.\",\"\\n\\u201cThe tracker will choose an ideal amount of sleep, like eight hours, and if you don\\u2019t get it, it dings you,\\u201d said Chris Winter, MD, a [neurologist](https://www.webmd.com/brain/neurologist-facts) and sleep specialist in Charlottesville, Virginia. \\u201cYou might only need seven hours of sleep. So take the ratings with a grain of salt.\\u201d\",\"\\nAll of this becomes problematic when the information makes you overly anxious and focused on what your tracker tells you. Certain personality types are more prone to this phenomenon, especially those with existing anxiety or perfectionist tendencies.\",\"\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m competitive, so I wanted to hit all the numbers,\\u201d Stern said. \\u201cI already hyper-schedule my life, so when I was scheduling my sleep and not hitting my targets, it caused anxiety.\\u201d\",\"\\nIf any of this sounds like you, it may be time to relearn how to self-regulate your sleep \\u2014 a skill helpful to anyone, not just the sleep-tracker obsessed. Step one is setting aside your tracker, at least for a while, said Oexman. He suggests 4 to 6 weeks as a starting point.\",\"\\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to be forever, but you need to rely on how you feel after a night\\u2019s sleep, not how your tracker tells you to feel,\\u201d he said.\",\"\\nRather than [sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis-causes-11) the details of the data, focus instead on consistency of sleep over time. Keeping a plain, old-fashioned sleep diary is a good, low-tech way to self-report and reflect on your sleep quality over time.\",\"\\n\\u201cWhen I use cognitive behavioral [therapy](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-physical-therapy) with patients who suffer from [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes), I have them track sleep by self-reporting in the morning,\\u201d said Short. \\u201cSleep is fairly subjective, not objective like the trackers suggest.\\u201d\",\"\\nPay attention to how you feel throughout the day, too, Oexman said. \\u201cTrust yourself on this. If you have enough energy and feel good, you\\u2019re getting enough quality rest.\\u201d\",\"\\nAnd it\\u2019s quality that matters most, he said, not quantity. When you deliberately spend more time in bed chasing extra sleep, you may not be doing yourself any favors. Instead, Oexman said, you might want to decrease your quantity to see if it improves your quality. Whether you go to bed later or wake up earlier is up to you, he said. But experiment with the amount of time you need in bed until quality sleep returns.\",\"\\nKeep in mind, too, that no matter how much or how well you sleep, an afternoon dip in energy is normal. While a nap may be tempting, that can leave you groggy and disrupt your nighttime sleep if it\\u2019s too long or too late in the day. Rather, going for a quick walk outside can boost energy through movement, increased [oxygen levels](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/how-to-increase-blood-oxygen-level), and exposure to natural sunlight \\u2014 all help combat fatigue without the risk of post-nap [drowsiness](https://www.webmd.com/drug-medication/medications-fatigue-and-sleepiness).\",\"\\nGetting [back](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/tips-for-pain-relief) to the basics of [sleep hygiene](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/what-is-sleep-hygiene) helps, too. Keeping your bedroom cool and dark, using it for sleep only \\u2014 not working in bed or watching TV \\u2014 and going to bed/rising at a consistent time, whatever that might be for your individual needs, can all pay off in helping you achieve sleep quality.\",\"\\nOnce you\\u2019ve returned to a healthy sleep routine and let go of any tracker-induced anxiety, you can slowly reintroduce the device back into your life, if you so desire, Winter said. Otherwise, follow in Stern\\u2019s footsteps and abandon the tracker for good.\",\"\\n\\u201cDo the things that are sleep promoting, and if the tracker qualifies, that\\u2019s fine,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut if you\\u2019re wigged out about the data and it goes from providing insights to becoming an obstacle to sleep, it\\u2019s time to get rid of it.\\u201d\",\"# Colorectal Cancer Resource Center\\n### What Is Colorectal Cancer?\\n\\nColorectal cancer, sometimes called\\u00a0colon cancer, starts when cells that line your colon or rectum grow out of control.\",\"# Colorectal Cancer Resource Center\\n### Symptoms of Colorectal Cancer\\n\\nIn its early stages,\\u00a0colorectal cancer\\u00a0may not have symptoms.

The exercise pattern was linked with a lower risk of 264 diseases and appeared to be just as effective at reducing risk as more frequent exercise spread throughout the week.\",\"\\nMost of the diseases studied affected the heart and blood vessels \\u2014 [atherosclerosis](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/what-is-atherosclerosis), [heart attack](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-disease-heart-attacks), heart failure, diabetes, [stroke](https://www.webmd.com/stroke/stroke) \\u2014 but researchers found that the benefit extended to a surprising range of conditions.\",\"\\n\\u201cIt was encouraging to see strong associations with chronic kidney disease,\\u201d said Shaan Khurshid, MD, MPH, lead author of the study and a cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. \\u201cWe also saw the association with sleep apnea, and even things like [gallstones](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/gallstones) and heartburn. These all make sense but had not been previously shown to this level of detail.\\u201d\",\"\\nThe \\u201cweekend warrior\\u201d concept is nothing new. In fact, the term [dates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/medjool-dates-health-benefits) back to the 1930s, referring to a military reservist who attends weekend meetings of their unit. By the 1980s, the name had expanded to include people who participate in strenuous activity part-time or only on weekends.\",\"\\nBut today, the concept is drawing more scientific attention as the subject of a mounting body of impressive research that promises greater flexibility in how you choose to achieve your workouts.\",\"\\nIn the new study, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed the data of 89,573 people from the UK Biobank, a group of relatively healthy middle-aged to older adults in the U.K. Participants wore accelerometers on their wrists that recorded their physical activity for one week.\",\"\\nThe scientists looked at the data and classified people into three groups: regular exercisers who worked out several times a week; weekend warriors, who got at least half of their exercise in one or two days; and inactive people, those who got less than the\\u00a0[U.S.-recommended 150 minutes](https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines) of moderate activity a week.\",\"\\nTechnically, the regular exercisers had slightly better results \\u2014 for example, 28% lower risk of high blood pressure compared to 23% for the weekend warriors, and 46% less risk for diabetes compared to 43%. But the differences weren\\u2019t big enough to be scientifically meaningful, leading the researchers to conclude that total exercise is what\\u2019s important for reducing disease risk, not how often you do it or how you split it up.\",\"\\nAnother 2024\\u00a0[trial](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00688-y) in _Nature Aging_ found that weekend warriors had a 26% lower risk of [dementia](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/types-dementia), 21% less risk of stroke, and a 45% reduction in the chance of developing Parkinson\\u2019s disease than inactive people. Like the newer study, the data set was also massive at more than 75,000 people.\",\"\\nAlso this year, the weekend warrior pattern was shown to be\\u00a0[just as effective as more frequent exercise for](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23986) [fat](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-is-visceral-fat) loss, helping people lose belly fat regardless of dietary changes.\",\"\\nIn 2022, a\\u00a0[study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2794038) following more than 350,000 Americans concluded there were no significant differences in mortality rates for weekend warriors versus regular exercisers.\",\"\\nFor one, advances in technology make it easier than ever to gather accurate information on people\\u2019s activity levels. \\u201cThey used to have people answer questionnaires,\\u201d said Khurshid, \\u201cand we know they tended to overestimate how active they are.\\u201d\",\"\\n\\u201c\\\\[People\\\\] are working and have lifestyles that make it harder to exercise during the week,\\u201d said Khurshid. \\u201cThe incidence of cardiometabolic disease is increasing globally.

The regular exercisers logged about 400 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity, on average, while the weekend warriors got slightly less than 300. \\u201cThis shows that if you work out every day, it\\u2019s easier for you to get your numbers up.\\u201d\",\"\\nThe study also had some notable limitations. The researchers didn\\u2019t gather any information on people\\u2019s lifestyles, specifically what kind of exercise they were doing, or exactly how intense it was. They also tracked people for only one week. While Kany said that should be predictive of how they lived the other 51 weeks of the year, he allows that it\\u2019s possible some of the participants upped their game when they got their accelerometers and did more activity than they normally would, potentially skewing the results.\",\"\\nThere\\u2019s also a question of safety. A\\u00a0[2014 study](https://www.canjsurg.ca/content/57/3/E62.long) found that of participants who had a severe injury, 55% did so working out on weekends. Since weekend warriors like to get as much in when they can, it\\u2019s conceivable that they might push themselves harder and could get hurt as a result.\",\"\\nOn the contrary, \\u201cthe literature supports that exercise is good for musculoskeletal conditions,\\u201d said Khurshid, \\u201csuch as chronic back pain. Looking at a population of almost 90,000 people, the signal for the benefit is so much stronger that we didn\\u2019t see a risk, but that\\u2019s not to say injury isn\\u2019t possible.\\u201d\",\"\\nThat risk may be greater for beginners or those with low fitness levels. \\u201cIf you didn\\u2019t exercise for three months and decided to be a weekend warrior out of the blue, I would say there\\u2019s a high risk of you injuring yourself,\\u201d Khurshid said.\",\"\\nStill, the bottom line is this: Given all the research-backed benefits of exercise for many health conditions, what seems to matter most is getting it in consistently, in whatever way your schedule allows.\",\"\\n\\u201cWhat I tell people is to get at least 150 minutes of exercise per week,\\u201d said Khurshid. \\u201cIf you can do more, that\\u2019s a good thing, and it doesn\\u2019t matter how you allocate it. Do it in a way that makes sense for you and allows you to be consistent over time.\\u201d\",\"\\nWhile being a weekend warrior can keep you healthy, Robert Linkul, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and trainer in Sacramento, California, specializing in older adults, still recommends being active more often if you can.\",\"\\n\\u201cIdeally, you should be a little bit active every day,\\u201d said Linkul, a member of the National Strength and Conditioning Association\\u2019s board of directors. He suggests breaking the 150-minute goal down into sessions averaging what should be a pretty doable 20 minutes a day.\",\"\\nIf you\\u2019re new to exercise, start by walking two or three days a week, and work up to rucking \\u2014 walking with a weighted backpack or vest (5 pounds is plenty). Rucking gets the heart rate up higher while keeping the workout low-impact and offers a strength component as well that can prevent muscle loss. Three other days per week, you should perform strength training (a recommendation that\\u2019s also part of the government\\u2019s physical activity guidelines but hasn\\u2019t been analyzed in weekend warrior studies).\",\"\\nBriefer, more frequent sessions help establish a pattern of exercise, making it easier to adopt as a part of your routine and lessening the chance you\\u2019ll overdo it on the weekend.\",\"\\n\\u201cThe body gets accustomed to doing action when you do it more frequently,\\u201d said Linkul.

Ultimately, time spent stationary and not moving was linked to increased health problems.\",\"\\nThe\\u00a0[findings](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/53/6/dyae136/7822310) were published Wednesday in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_. For the study, researchers didn\\u2019t specifically evaluate people who used standing desks. Instead, they analyzed data from 83,013 adults who used a wearable device that could detect their daily time spent sitting and standing for a week. The average age of the people in the study was 61 years old, and about 55% were women.\",\"\\nThe researchers then looked at the people\\u2019s health data for the next seven years and linked time spent sitting, standing, or both to how likely someone was to have heart disease, a [stroke](https://www.webmd.com/stroke/stroke), heart failure, or circulatory problems like a potentially deadly [blood clot](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/blood-clots) in the leg or enlarged and twisted veins that can be uncomfortable.\",\"\\nOn average, people in the study spent nearly 13 hours per day stationary, meaning sitting or standing combined. About 2 hours were spent standing, and 11 hours spent sitting.\",\"\\nPeople whose combined sitting and standing time exceeded 12 hours per day had an increased risk of circulatory problems, and that risk increased for every extra hour spent stationary. When the researchers looked at just time spent sitting or time spent standing, circulatory health risk steadily increased beyond two hours of standing or 10 hours of sitting.\",\"\\nExtra time spent sitting beyond 10 hours daily also was linked to an increased risk of problems with the heart and blood vessels.

If your [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) overreacts, you have an allergy. Your body will produce antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE).\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nThere are different types of allergy tests. Which one your doctor chooses depends on your symptoms and the suspected causes.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nYour health care provider will use a thin needle that contains an allergen to prick your skin. Or they might put droplets of allergens on your skin and then scratch your skin so the allergens can get in. The test could use your forearm or back. If you're allergic, within 15 minutes, a rash or raised spots \\u2013 called wheals \\u2013 will appear. You might be tested for many allergies at once.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nIf the [skin-prick test](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/skin-test) doesn't yield enough information, your doctor may try this test next. A small amount of an allergen is injected into the outer layer of your skin. The doctor is looking for a rash or other reaction.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nThis checks for contact dermatitis, a reaction that happens when your skin comes in contact with an allergen. Your health care provider puts drops of an allergen on the surface of your skin and covers the spot with a bandage. Or the allergen may be on the bandage itself. You leave the bandage in place for at least 2 days. Then you go back to your doctor, who removes the bandage and checks for a reaction.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nYour health care provider draws a blood sample and sends it to a lab. At the lab, allergens are added to your blood, and then it's tested for levels of IgE antibodies. This test has a higher rate of false positives, indicating you have an allergy when you really don't.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nTypically, an allergy specialist, called an allergist, does this test. You'll swallow a small amount of a suspected allergen \\u2013 a food or drug \\u2013 while a health care provider closely watches you in case you get anaphylaxis. If you do, you'll get an [epinephrine](https://www.webmd.com/brain/difference-between-epinephrine-and-norepinephrine) shot right away to stop the reaction.\",\"## Testing for Allergies\\n\\nTo prepare for an allergy test, you'll need to stop your allergy medication 3 to 7 days ahead of time. Those drugs can interfere with the test.\",\"## Allergies and Your Diet\\n\\nThere is no cure for allergies, including what you eat. But your diet might help with how bad your symptoms get. Here are some of the foods that researchers are studying to see if they might help ease allergies.\",\"## Allergies and Your Diet\\n\\nResearchers are studying whether polyunsaturated fatty acids such as [omega-3s](https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/omega-3-fatty-acids-fact-sheet) can help prevent allergies in children. Foods such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts are high in omega-3s, which help ease inflammation. Researchers think eating these may lower the risk of childhood asthma and allergy.\",\"## Allergies and Your Diet\\n\\nIn one Swedish study, children who had higher levels of these fatty acids in their blood at age 8 were less likely to have nasal allergies by age 16. But more research is needed to confirm if that is because of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets or something else.\",\"## Allergies and Your Diet\\n\\nA large study of children in Crete (part of Greece) found that children who stuck to a Mediterranean diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, and legumes and [nuts](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-nuts) were less likely to have hay fever.\",\"# Transforming Patient-Centric Cancer Care\\n### More Resources Needed to Detect Cancer Earlier\\n\\nScreenings have cut cancer rates, but there\\u2019s a lot of work to be done when it comes to awareness, disparities, and vaccines, author Bruce Ratner says.\",\"# Transforming Patient-Centric Cancer Care\\n### The 4 Ps of Cancer Care: Policy, Politics, Priorities, and Prevention\\n\\nAstraZeneca's David Fredrickson is encouraged by the latest cancer research and discusses the four Ps: Policy, Politics, Priorities, and Prevention.\",\"# Transforming Patient-Centric Cancer Care\\n### Doing Handstands to Fund Pediatric Cancer Research\\n\\nWebMD's Chief Medical Officer, John Whyte, MD, speaks with Caryn Freiberger, organizer of the Gotham Gymnastics Handstand Walk with Eloise, about her initiative to raise funds and awareness for pediatric cancer research.\",\"# Transforming Patient-Centric Cancer Care\\n### Early Detection May Define the Future of Pancreatic Cancer Care\\n\\nWebMD's Chief Medical Officer, John Whyte, MD, speaks with Lynn Matrisian, PhD, MBA, chief science officer of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN), about new screening tests for pancreatic cancer and the hope of finding this hard-to-diagnose condition earlier.\",\"# Transforming Patient-Centric Cancer Care\\n### Cancer Screenings and Prevention\\n\\nJohn Whyte, MD, chief medical officer at WebMD, and gastroenterologist Paul Limburg, MD, talk about the incredible advances in cancer screenings over the past several years, especially for colorectal cancers.\",\"## What Is Alzheimer\\u2019s?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a disease that robs you of your memory.

Only the people closest to the person with the disease may be able to tell a difference in behavior.\",\"## Alzheimer's Disease Stages\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll likely still be able to drive and take part in social activities at this stage, but you may have trouble remembering details, doing certain tasks, planning or organizing, and you may lose things.\",\"## Alzheimer's Disease Stages\\n\\nThis is usually the longest stage of Alzheimer\\u2019s. It can last for years. Someone in this stage will progress slowly toward more severe symptoms over time. Symptoms will become easier to notice, and they\\u2019ll get in the way of everyday living.\",\"## Alzheimer's Disease Stages\\n\\nYou may start to notice more behavioral changes in this stage, as daily life becomes more difficult to navigate and confusion happens more often. You may need a dedicated caregiver or a group setting for living to stay safe and thrive.\",\"## Alzheimer's Disease Stages\\n\\nThis stage of Alzheimer\\u2019s can often require round-the-clock care.

It could be that certain forms of it cause brain damage. Some scientists think it plays a role in building the plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer\\u2019s.\",\"## Alzheimer\\u2019s Causes\\n\\nThe answer to this question is complicated. Researchers have identified several mutations in genes that are linked to Alzheimer\\u2019s and may increase or decrease a person\\u2019s risk of getting the disease.

This can cause belly pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The cause is typically inflammation triggered by your immune system's response to a viral or bacterial infection. However, infections caused by fungi or parasites or irritation from chemicals can also lead to gastroenteritis.\",\"## What Is Gastroenteritis?\\n\\nGastroenteritis is when you have infection and inflammation in your stomach or intestines. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images)\",\"## What Is Gastroenteritis?\\n\\nYou may have heard the term \\\"stomach flu.\\\" When people say this, they usually mean gastroenteritis caused by a virus. However, it's not actually related to the flu, or influenza, which is a different virus that affects your upper respiratory system (nose, throat, and lungs).\",\"## Gastroenteritis Symptoms\\n\\nGastroenteritis symptoms often start with little warning. You'll usually get nausea, cramps, [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/diarrhea-stomach-flu), and vomiting. Expect to make several trips to the toilet in rapid succession. Other symptoms tend to develop a little later on and include:\",\"## Gastroenteritis Symptoms\\n\\nBecause of diarrhea and vomiting, you also can become dehydrated. Watch for signs of dehydration, such as dry skin, a dry mouth, feeling lightheaded, and being really thirsty. Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Symptoms\\n\\nIt depends on what caused it. But generally, acute gastroenteritis lasts about 14 days. Persistent gastroenteritis lasts between 14 and 30 days, and chronic gastroenteritis lasts over 30 days.\",\"## Stomach Flu and Children\\n\\nChildren and infants can get dehydrated quickly. If they do, they need to go to the doctor as soon as possible. Some [signs of dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) in kids include:\",\"## Stomach Flu and Children\\n\\nWhen caused by an infection \\u2014 most often a virus \\u2014 gastroenteritis is contagious. Young kids are more likely to have severe symptoms. Keep children with gastroenteritis out of\\u00a0day care or school until all their symptoms are gone.\",\"## Stomach Flu and Children\\n\\nTwo vaccines are available by mouth to help protect children from infection with one of the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis: rotavirus. The two vaccines are called RotaTeq and Rotarix. Kids can get them starting at 2 months of age. Ask your doctor if your child should get a vaccine.\",\"## Stomach Flu and Children\\n\\nCheck with your doctor before giving your child any medicine. Doctors don't usually recommend giving kids younger than 5 years over-the-counter drugs to control vomiting. They also don't recommend giving kids younger than 12 drugs to control diarrhea (some doctors won't recommend them for people under 18).\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nThe most common cause of gastroenteritis is a virus.\\u00a0The main types are norovirus and rotavirus. You usually get exposed to a virus through:\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nYou'll usually start getting symptoms about 12-48 hours after you're exposed. You'll probably be sick for about 1-3 days, and you'll be contagious for up to 2 weeks after you start to feel better.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nBoth adults and kids get rotavirus, but kids are more likely to have serious symptoms, such as severe dehydration. You can get it at any time, but it has a seasonal peak in the U.S. from January through June. Kids are most likely to get it then, and they can spread it fast to friends and family they have close contact with.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nYou'll usually start getting symptoms about 1-3 days after you're exposed. You'll probably be sick for about 5-7 days and contagious for a few days after you start to feel better.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nAstrovirus usually causes a fairly mild infection, with watery diarrhea. Anyone can get infected with it, but most adults will have immunity because they've had an infection at some point in their past. Infection is most common in:\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nYou'll usually start getting symptoms about 4-5 days after you're exposed, and you'll probably be sick for about 1-4 days.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nThere are several strains of adenovirus. Infection with one of these usually causes a cough, runny nose, and fever. But sometimes, [adenovirus](https://www.webmd.com/children/adenovirus-infections) infection can cause stomach problems. Anyone can get it, but it's most common in kids younger than 5 years. When adults get it, it's usually because they live in more crowded areas, such as dormitories, military quarters, or nursing homes. You're also more likely to get it if you have a weakened immune system, and you may get seriously sick.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nYou'll usually start getting sick about 3-10 days after you're exposed, and you may be sick for as long as 2 weeks. If you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough, they may linger for a while after you otherwise feel better.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nBacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ and salmonella can also trigger the stomach flu. But this isn't as common as cases that are caused by a virus.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nSalmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. These bacteria are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nAnother bacteria, shigella, is often passed around in day care centers. It's typically spread from person to person, but it's also commonly spread through contaminated food and drinking water.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Causes\\n\\nParasites can also cause gastroenteritis, but it's not common. You can pick up organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium in contaminated swimming pools or by drinking contaminated water.\",\"\\n**Exposure.** This is when you first come into contact with the virus. Symptoms usually take some time to develop, so you won't likely know you were exposed until you start getting sick.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Incubation.** Once you've been exposed, it takes some time for the virus to infect your cells and start to reproduce. This is called the [incubation period](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-incubation-period). It generally lasts 1-10 days, depending on which virus has infected you.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Acute infection.** As your immune system responds to the infection, you'll develop inflammation. This is what triggers your symptoms, which can last 1-14 days, depending on the type of virus you're infected with.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Recovery.** During this period, your symptoms start to go away and you'll feel better. However, you may still be contagious for up to 2 weeks afterward, depending on which virus caused your infection.\\n\\n\",\"## Stomach Flu Stages\\n\\nGastroenteritis is not contagious, but the infections that cause it are. For example, viruses are usually spread through bodily fluids, such as spit, and poop. If someone with an infection uses the bathroom or coughs or sneezes without washing their hands afterward, they can transfer the virus to every surface they touch. One of the best ways of protecting yourself from getting infected is to wash your hands frequently throughout your day, especially before you eat or touch your face. Also, make sure you wash fresh fruits and vegetables before you eat them, and don't make food for other people if you're sick.\",\"## Stomach Flu Stages\\n\\nThis depends on what is causing your infection. Most cases of viral gastroenteritis will be over in a few days, but you may be sick for up to 2 weeks with some viruses, such as adenovirus.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Risk Factors\\n\\nGastroenteritis is common during pregnancy. About 30% of pregnant people will have gastroenteritis at some point in their pregnancy. Without treatment, you can get dehydrated, which can trigger early labor. If you are pregnant and you can't keep clear liquids down, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Treatment\\n\\nMost people won't need specific treatment for gastroenteritis. You'll likely get better on your own after a few days. The best thing you can do to speed up your recovery is to rest at home, stay hydrated, and eat bland food.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Treatment\\n\\nAntibiotics can\\u2019t treat viral gastroenteritis. They are not often used for bacterial gastroenteritis, either, as your infection should resolve on its own in a few days. However, some bacteria do require antibiotic treatment. Your doctor may do tests to help decide if you need antibiotics.\",\"## Gastroenteritis Treatment\\n\\nInfants and children can get dehydrated faster than adults. Kids who are dehydrated need to go see a doctor. Keep them hydrated with a hydration solution, and avoid drinks with too much caffeine and sugar, which can make their diarrhea worse, such as:\",\"## When to Call a Doctor\\n\\nCall 911 if you or your child has dehydration. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\",\"## Gastroenteritis Prevention\\n\\nThere\\u2019s no guaranteed way to prevent the types of infections that lead to gastroenteritis. However, you can take steps to reduce your risk of getting sick and spreading germs to others, such as:\",\"\\n**Wash your hands.** This is one of the most important and easiest ways to prevent getting an infection. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Handle food safely.** Wash your hands before and after you handle food. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before you eat them. Cook, serve, and store food safely.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Eat safe when you travel.** When you travel, you come into contact with germs that you may not otherwise. This can give you a case of traveler's diarrhea. To avoid this, drink bottled water, and only eat food that is packaged, peeled, or cooked.\\n\\n\",\"## Takeaways\\n\\nGastroenteritis is inflammation from an infection in your stomach and intestines. It can cause nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, which may cause dehydration. How long your symptoms last depends on what's causing your infection. Most people's immune systems will clear the infection in a few days.\",\"\\nWhen caring for an older adult, it's important not to overlook routine care -- stuff that seems obvious but that may not be on your radar.

But some older adults (and young ones, too) reason that since they just saw the doctor last month about that [sinus](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-tips) problem, they don't need to go again. A visit to the doctor for a specific problem, however, doesn't take the place of a complete checkup.\",\"\\nMake sure your parent is eating a balanced diet. Accompany them to the market to guide shopping choices, teach how to read labels, and discuss the importance of all the food groups, vitamins, fiber, and [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details).\",\"\\nID jewelry with pertinent medical alert and contact information should be worn by all older adults. There is a huge variety of bracelets, pendants, and even watchbands available. One company that sells them is [American Medical Identifications](https://www.americanmedical-id.com/).\",\"\\nKnow your mother's baseline -- what's \\\"normal\\\" for them. Some older adults have a lower normal body temperature than 98.6 degrees Farenheit, and others have had chronic problems throughout their lives. Be familiar with Mom's \\\"default setting,\\\" and be aware of changes. Know that baselines change as a person ages. If, for instance, they go\\u00a0through surgery, chances are they will come out of it with a new baseline.\",\"\\nKnow your loved one's complete medical history and keep a record of it to be taken to doctor's appointments and checked often. Just as important is to know your own medical history, in case genetic issues arise or transplants or transfusions become necessary.\",\"\\nUnless told otherwise by your doctor, you should each be drinking eight glasses of water a day. Did you know that [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) is a common cause of many disorders in older adults, including circulation problems? Make sure liquids are available all day long. How about an attractive thermos for the bedside or a water cooler in the living room and on the patio?

Consult a doctor immediately.\",\"\\nConsult a podiatrist immediately for corns, [calluses](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-corns-calluses-basics), [bunions](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-bunions-basics), [blisters](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blisters-basics), sores, and infections, or ingrown, hard, brittle, split, or discolored toenails. If your senior has problem feet, a weekly trip to a salon for a [pedicure](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-pedicure) makes a great outing. Most salons have special discount days for older adults. Don't forget to ask about these.\",\"\\nKeep a checklist -- a \\\"report card\\\" -- and update it periodically to keep track of how your parent is doing with meal preparation, housework, mobility (in and out of the house), laundry, shopping, money issues, medications, bathing, dressing, and eating. These are key activities of daily living (ADLs), and difficulty with them indicates there may be trouble.\",\"\\nIf your parent or parents live in a multilevel home but has problems with stairs, consider a chair lift. They are not inexpensive, but they can be cheaper than moving and will help keep your parent independent for a longer time. For someone who sits a lot, an ergonomic chair that offers greater lumbar support and adjustable features (chair height, armrest height, seat depth) can make a huge difference in overall health. Ergonomic chairs come in all kinds of models and varying prices.\",\"\\nIf an ergonomic chair is not an option, make sure your father's chair has an adjustable height feature, the seat depth is approximately two-thirds the length of their thighs and buttocks, the back is at least fourteen inches high, and the armrests are no more than nine inches high.\",\"\\nBad posture can complicate back problems and limit mobility.

Experiment with old recipes to make them more palatable and \\\"legal\\\" (use lactose-free milk, salt and sugar substitutes, ground meat instead of cubed, or yogurt instead of cream, but first consult a doctor about the interaction of these substitutes with any medications). There are tons of books on the subject and most have recipes. Consult them.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nIf your loved one is having trouble gaining or maintaining weight, pack their diet with liquid calories. Fruit juices, milk, and milk alternatives such as soy, rice, and nut milks are high in nutrients and calories and are much less filling than solid foods. Smoothies, yogurt shakes, and protein drinks are a little more filling, but may still make a good meal alternative.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nRespect your father's tastes. If they have\\u00a0hated yogurt all their life, don't start feeding it to them now just because they are less able to resist.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nFour or five smaller meals during the day can be more manageable than three large ones. This approach has the added benefit of keeping blood sugar levels more even throughout the day.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nIf your parent has vision problems, use the \\\"clock\\\" method of serving food: the main dish is right in front of them at \\\"six o'clock,\\\" the starch dish is farthest and directly opposite at \\\"twelve o'clock,\\\" and so on.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nWhen family and friends call and ask what gift they can bring, suggest prepared foods. (If your parent gets Meals on Wheels deliveries, save the goodies for the weekend.)\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nIt's OK to bring a special meal to a restaurant for your parent and ask to have it microwaved for you, just as long as everyone else is ordering off the menu. Waiters and waitresses want to help you; tell them what you need privately, to avoid embarrassment. And a good chef, if they are not too busy, can accommodate anyone. Show your appreciation, and tip accordingly.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nDry food can be difficult to swallow. Use sauces generously, but learn to make healthy versions.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nFor those who refuse regular meals, keep healthy snacks (fruits, nutritious cookies, cut-up vegetables) available around the house.

Keep condiments to a minimum.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nFreely make use of microwaveable prepackaged foods. You can stock up on them and put them in the freezer after marking each with the day of the week when it should be eaten.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nIf your loved one can't swallow thin liquids, someone has probably recommended Thick-It, a tasteless powder that thickens hot and cold liquids. The canister is bulky, so keep small supplies of Thick-It in your bag to use on outings. If Dad's not supposed to drink unthickened liquid, don't cheat, not even \\\"just this once.\\\"\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nTake your parent to lunch, even if you're at work. Call at lunchtime, and you can eat together -- you at the desk, they at home in the kitchen. But remember that it's dangerous for an older person (or anyone else) to talk while chewing.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nYour parent's peak period of digestion (when it's easiest to digest food) is midday. Plan the large meal for that time of day, and keep supper light.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nWhen feeding your father, only put one teaspoon of food in their mouth at once. Alternate spoonfuls of solids and liquids.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nPlan your mother's weekly menu ahead of time so shopping for all meals can be done at once. Copy their recipes onto cards and write the shopping list for each dish on the backs. Take the cards with you when you go shopping.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nOlder adults who seem to have endless appetites often forget they have just eaten. Put stickers on the clock for mealtimes so they can see how long it is until the next meal. Making small nutritious snacks available throughout the day is also helpful.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nYour parent should never lie down right after a meal -- that is the most common cause of indigestion. (Eating too fast is the second most common cause.) Make sure Mom sits or stands for at least an hour after they eat.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nMany medications leave an awful taste in the mouth that is far worse than anything you can imagine. They can make sugar taste like salt, and some favorite foods become completely inedible. Be especially patient during this time as you try new things to see what works. In the meantime, a lollipop may help your loved one after they have\\u00a0eaten something distasteful. (Don't give sucking candies to anyone who might easily swallow them whole.)\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nYou can get someone to come to the house just to feed meals to your parent. Contact your Area Agency on Aging.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nEven if Mom isn't making use of the local senior center, they can attend every day just for meals. If salt is an issue, there are a bunch of flavorful seasoning substitutes on the market.\",\"## Eating and the Older Adult\\n\\nThere are tons of special utensils that can make eating a lot easier; a combination fork and knife for one-handed eating, a tilted spoon for someone with hand problems, or a two-handled mug for easier drinking are available from the many suppliers of special-needs items.

Reading, watching TV, and so forth, should be done in a favorite chair, while bed is for sleep only. Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day will also help train their body for better sleep overall.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nOlder adults should avoid oversleeping in the morning. It leads to having trouble falling asleep later, and the cycle of insomnia begins.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf Dad can't fall asleep within fifteen minutes of getting into bed, suggest them to get up for a while and do something calming, and then try again later.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nDon't take sleep disruption lightly. It can be caused by an improper dose of medication, an illness, or a psychological problem. Talk about it with your loved one's doctor. Many drugs, including Halcion and even the antidepressants that are supposed to make their life better, can cause terrifying nightmares.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf your father wakes with night terrors, be reassuring. Show them that there's no danger nearby, but avoid arguing. If they insist\\u00a0that something (or someone) woke them, let them know that whatever the trouble was, it's gone now.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nPeople of any age who have difficulty sleeping should avoid exercise in the late afternoon and evening. Try morning walks instead.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nAvoid caffeine, not just in the evening but at any time of day. Aside from coffee, tea, and cola, look out for caffeine in chocolate, non-cola soft drinks, and some pain relievers. And while decaffeinated coffee has less caffeine than regular, it's not caffeine-free.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nAlcohol can make your senior drowsy at first, but it hurts healthy sleep in the long run by disturbing the sleep cycle, making sleep less restful, and making them more likely to wake up during the night.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nMaintain a sleep diary to note sleep patterns. The doctor will find this information useful if you need to consult with her, and you might discover patterns you weren't aware of: Is sleeping a problem the night before the family comes to visit? Is this about anxiety or excitement? Visit the [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/) for more information.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf there are serious issues that require discussion, don't bring these up right before bedtime. Avoid arguments.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nSome people swear by a teaspoon of honey in a cup of hot water before bedtime. Others go for warm milk with a little cinnamon. But if liquids are a problem before bed, find a different solution. A foot bath or massage right before bed can help.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nGet dark-lined (blackout) shades for people who don't sleep well, and block out disturbing noise with a fan or a white noise machine. Some models have a choice of sounds that mimic ocean waves, the patter of raindrops, and other soothing sounds.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nAromatherapy using lavender candles and potpourri can be very relaxing. Try a couple drops of lavender oil in a bath or on the corner of your parent's pillow. You can even buy soft microwavable products that warm up potpourri inside.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nChange the linens often. Everyone enjoys fresh sheets. You can even buy lavender water to put in the wash. It's sold in a lot of home stores and catalogs these days.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nUnpleasant odors can interfere with sleep. Use potpourri and make sure the air in the room has a chance to circulate. When Mom's out of the room for a while, open the windows or light a scented candle.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nCreate a sleep ritual before bedtime and follow this every evening. If you live far away, you can still call at bedtime to wish your parents sweet dreams.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nRestless leg syndrome is a condition in which one leg or both legs experience nervous sensations that cause excessive movement. It's a fairly common condition that can often be treated with medication, iron supplements, and exercise. Is this what's keeping your loved one awake? Find out more online and talk to your doctor.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nDoes Dad's snoring rock the house? Is Grandma really sleepy in the morning and drowsy during the day? They may have sleep apnea, a disorder in which the person stops breathing at points during sleep. Consistent loud snoring, observed episodes of not breathing, and morning and daytime sleepiness are some of the warning signs. Men, people who are over forty, and people who are overweight are all at higher risk, but anyone can have it, and it's more common than diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, memory problems, excessive drowsiness, depression, impotence -- the list goes on.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nMake sure the mattress your father sleeps on is comfortable and right for them. Soft beds are nice, but maybe they need\\u00a0more support. It's easier to rise from a firm mattress.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nSome people are just not morning people. If getting your parent up every morning is a problem and you already have enough to do at that hour, let them stay in bed until midmorning, if they like, and get them up after the family has gone off to work and school.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nWhile it may be tempting to take naps, they should be avoided if they interfere with getting a good night's sleep.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nArrange calming activities before bedtime; this is a time for reading, soft music, and soothing conversation. Have your loved one spend some time in pajamas before settling in to sleep.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nMaybe Mom can't sleep because they have issues they can't talk about. Try to discuss this with them, or suggest they discuss the problem with another member of the family or a professional.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nRemind your senior to go to the bathroom before going to sleep. If they get\\u00a0up often at night to go to the bathroom, suggest that they don't drink any liquids for three or four hours before bedtime. On the other hand, don't skimp too much on fluids during the day because you want to cut down on bathroom visits. Older adults often become dehydrated, which leads to painful (but common) urinary tract infections.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nA baby monitor will alert you to any nighttime problems your parent may be having, and they will feel secure knowing that if they call\\u00a0in the middle of the night, you will hear them. Show them how the monitor works.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf it's the bed that's keeping your father awake, consider getting a hospital bed. Medicare will pay for it if their doctor recommends it.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nA foam \\\"egg crate\\\" mattress will help prevent bedsores and can be purchased from any medical supply house.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nRotate a new mattress once a month the first year and every season (four times a year) after that. A mattress should be replaced every eight to ten years.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf they sleep in the same bed but Mom needs a firm mattress and Dad prefers something softer, consider getting two single beds and moving them next to each other. You can use king- or queen-sized bedding, so it looks like one bed. This allows many couples to feel comfortable without giving up intimacy.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nA clock with brightly illuminated numbers can keep someone awake. Use the dimmer on the clock if it has one, turn the clock to the wall, or get a new clock.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nSome people have trouble sleeping because their biological clocks are waking them at weird times. To \\\"reset\\\" Dad's biological clock, have them get up in the morning at the time they are like to awaken each day and spend about ten minutes facing the sun.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nIf your mother grinds their teeth at night -- a common condition called bruxism -- talk to the dentist. Mom might need a mouth guard.\",\"## Sleep and Older Adults\\n\\nKeep familiar, favorite photos at the bedside to calm Mom in case they wake\\u00a0up confused about where they are. If they travel\\u00a0or have to spend some time in the hospital, keep these same items at their bedside there for continuity.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nNowhere is the saying, \\\"use it or lose it,\\\" more meaningful than among older adults. Aside from its cardiovascular benefits, exercise combats depression and osteoporosis, reduces the risk of falling, cuts down on healing time when there are injuries and illnesses, and generally improves lifestyle. Encourage your grandmother to stick to a routine.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nAsk your older relative to keep an exercise log and consult it often. Compliment their progress and celebrate breakthroughs.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nYoga is a great form of gentle exercise that improves the immune system and promotes well-being, among many other benefits. Weight training, tai chi, swimming, and low-impact aerobics are also generally beneficial to seniors.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nMake your own exercise video for your mother. They might hate the idea of staring at a nubile twenty-something while they do\\u00a0their stretching exercises, but what if, instead, they had an image of you or their granddaughter guiding them through the routine? If you own a video camera, don't pass up this opportunity to make each day more special for them.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nSet up an area of your Dad's home where they can exercise safely. Make it special: get an attractive exercise mat and maybe even hang up an inspirational poster. Get them colorful workout wear or a funny T-shirt (\\\"Over the hill? What hill?\\\").\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nIf you can't go yourself, hire a reliable teen to take your parent for a walk. The outing might be less awkward if you give it a purpose, like a daily trip to the store for bagels and a newspaper.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nThings change. From time to time, review your loved one's exercise routine to make sure it's still appropriate.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nCheck with a doctor or physical therapist before your loved one embarks on any exercise routine.\",\"\\n**\\\"I've heard that advice about a million times and was assured by our family doctor that Dad's calisthenics were just fine for him. But it never occurred to me to check back after he developed a minor ear infection that left him with a slight balancing problem. It turned out that even some of the neck rolls he was doing were affecting his ability to stand up without getting dizzy.\\\"**\\n\\n\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nIf your grandfather isn't motivated to exercise, take them\\u00a0to a ball game to remind them of what it was like to have the wind blow through their hair (when they had hair). Walking to your seats is enough to get the body moving, and the fresh air will do wonders for them.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nBring your older parent to a physical therapist for advice and general guidance. If you can get Dad's doctor to recommend the visit, insurance will pay for it. If not, it'll be a worthy expense, given the possible benefits.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nAll exercise routines, even walking, should start and end with a period of stretching. A stretch needs to be held for at least five seconds to be effective.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nIf your father refuses to exercise, try to get them to at least work on one of the important muscle groups: arms, legs, shoulders, or back.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nExercising to music is always more fun, especially if the music is your favorite. Make your loved one a special exercise tape of their favorite tunes. If your parent totally resists the idea of exercise, don't try to bully them into it.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nThe mall opens before the stores do, and in many areas, people have discovered that they're a great place to walk. Aisles are nice and wide, and it's temperature-controlled.It's also a great way to meet people. Make sure security has arrived on duty by the time your parent or grandparent gets there.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nConsider a professional personal trainer. Even if it's too expensive to have one regularly, a couple sessions will get Mom started on the right track and allow them to develop an appropriate routine.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nIt's a good idea for someone else to be around when your parent exercises, just in case there are problems. If you or a family member can't be there, this is a potential job for a responsible teen.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nAn hour of brisk walking four times a week can drastically improve the quality of life for an older person -- or anyone else, for that matter.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nStart a senior exercise class in your dad's neighborhood. A small group can pool their resources and hire a teacher just for them, at their convenience. If no one has a basement big enough, ask restaurant owners whether their private rooms, which are rarely used during the daytime, can be made available. Or, perhaps the local school can let them use part of the gym when it's not being used.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nWalking is still the best exercise there is. Learn to enjoy walking slowly with your loved one.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nYoga classes can be beneficial to both you and your loved one. Consider taking classes together.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nIf your parent hates the idea of walking, ask them to help you by running certain errands for you (\\\"Dad, could you return this to the library for me?\\\").\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nSwimming is often an option for older adults who have lost mobility. Also, water exercise classes are available at many swimming facilities.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nDancing: it's good exercise, it's a great social activity, the music can be therapeutic, and it's a wonderful way to meet people. Find out what classes are available locally, and don't ignore those classes that are aimed at kids. Instructors at those classes might be willing to start offering adult classes if enough students can be gathered.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nLook into special exercise programs for older adults in the neighborhood. Visit the classes on your own before you suggest your parent joins. There are some good ones out there, but some can be depressing to those who are fairly vital.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nSqueezing balls of clay is good exercise for arthritic hands, as are therapeutic squeeze balls made just for that purpose. They're available at most drugstores.\",\"## Exercise and Older Adults\\n\\nOlder adults have found that weight lifting using relatively light weights strengthens the body, helps bone density, increases flexibility, and reassures them of their abilities.\",\"\\nFrom embarrassing gas to uncomfortable heartburn, everyone has digestive problems from time to time. The good news is there are some simple solutions for many of your troubles. Learn about what causes your discomfort, how to prevent and manage digestive problems, what questions to ask your pharmacist, and when to see a doctor.\",\"## The Digestive System\\n\\nIt may seem like digestion only happens in your\\u00a0stomach, but it\\u2019s a long process that involves many organs. Together they form the digestive tract.\",\"## The Digestive System\\n\\nDigestion begins in your mouth, where\\u00a0saliva starts to break down food when you chew. When you swallow, your chewed food moves to your\\u00a0esophagus, a tube that connects your throat to your\\u00a0stomach. Muscles in the esophagus push the food down to a valve at the bottom of your esophagus, which opens to let food into the stomach.\",\"## The Digestive System\\n\\nYour stomach breaks food down using stomach acids. Then the food moves into the small intestine. There, digestive juices from several organs, like your\\u00a0pancreas and\\u00a0gallbladder, break down the food more, and nutrients are absorbed. What\\u2019s left goes through your large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water. The waste then moves out of your body through the rectum and\\u00a0anus.\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nGas is a normal part of healthy digestion. Air that is in your digestive tract is either released through your\\u00a0mouth as a burp or through your anus as gas. You typically pass gas 13 to 21 times a day.\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nGas is created when you swallow air, such as when you eat and drink. But it\\u2019s also a byproduct of the breakdown of food. Some foods cause more gas than others. You may also be more sensitive to particular foods and may have more gas when you eat them.\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve probably noticed you feel gassy after eating certain foods. Cut back on the common culprits:\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nWhen gas builds up in your stomach and\\u00a0intestines, you may have bloating \\u2013 swelling in your belly and a feeling of fullness. It may happen to you more often if you have:\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nWhile bloating is usually just uncomfortable, it can sometimes\\u00a0cause pain in your belly or sides.\",\"## Gas and Bloating\\n\\nIf you have a lot of gas or are very uncomfortable, an over-the-counter medicine may help.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nHeartburn, sometimes called acid\\u00a0indigestion, is a painful, burning feeling in the middle of your chest or the upper part of your stomach. The pain, which can also spread to your neck, jaw, or arms, can last just a few minutes or stick with you for hours.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a muscle at the entrance of your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that acts like a gate: It opens to let food move from your esophagus to your stomach, and it shuts to stop food and acid from coming back out.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nWhen the LES opens too often or isn\\u2019t tight enough, stomach acid can rise up into the esophagus and cause the burning feeling.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nYou might have noticed that your heartburn gets worse when you eat or drink certain things. Here are a few that can\\u00a0trigger heartburn:\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nBig meals can also set off heartburn. Instead of eating three big meals a day, try to eat several small meals throughout the day.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nExercise has more than a few health perks. Among them is weight loss, which can help you avoid getting heartburn in the first place if you are overweight. But some types of exercise can trigger the burning sensation. You\\u2019ll be less likely to reach for your heartburn medicine if you avoid crunches and inverted poses in\\u00a0yoga. You may need to find alternatives to high-impact workouts. For example, bicycle or swim instead of going for a run.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nEveryone has heartburn from time to time. But when you have it frequently (at least twice a week for a few weeks), or when it begins to interfere with your daily life or damage your esophagus, your doctor may tell you that you have a long-term condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It\\u2019s also known as\\u00a0acid reflux disease. Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nFrequent heartburn is a symptom of GERD. It\\u2019s important to get help if you have heartburn frequently so you can avoid complications from GERD and uncover any other problems. Call your doctor or make an appointment with a [gastroenterologist](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/what-gastroenterologists-do), who specializes in digestive illnesses.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nOver time, heartburn that isn\\u2019t treated or controlled well by lifestyle changes or medicine may cause serious problems, including:\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nSeveral types of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines can help with heartburn. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find the one that\\u2019s right for you.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nSoothe occasional, mild heartburn with an antacid that contains\\u00a0calcium carbonate or\\u00a0magnesium. They help neutralize stomach acid. Some prevent acid reflux. Those that contain magnesium may also help heal stomach ulcers. They come in liquids and pills and are fast-acting.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nAntacids can cause\\u00a0constipation and diarrhea. Look for brands that contain\\u00a0calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide to reduce these side effects. Don\\u2019t take antacids with magnesium if you have chronic [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information). Some antacids have a lot of salt, so you should take them only for occasional heartburn.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nH2 blockers help relieve and prevent occasional heartburn by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Though they don\\u2019t work as fast as antacids, their effects last longer. Your doctor may tell you to take an antacid and an H2 blocker together. H2 blockers are for short-term use \\u2013 less than 2 weeks. You can take them before your meals to prevent heartburn, or at\\u00a0bedtime. They come in liquids and pills.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nAll H2 blockers work about the same. So if one doesn\\u2019t help with your heartburn, switching to a different one isn\\u2019t likely to help. Switching to a higher-dose prescription version of the drug might help, though. Talk to your doctor if over-the-counter H2 blockers aren't working for you.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nTalk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines and you need to take an H2 blocker.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nPPIs are used to prevent frequent heartburn that happens more than twice a week. They work by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Often, they work better than H2 blockers. You also can take these drugs for a longer period of time than H2 blockers.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nPPIs are available over the counter and by prescription. But if you have GERD, you may need prescription-strength medication.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nYou need to take PPIs once a day on an empty stomach so they\\u2019ll work best. Usually you\\u2019ll take the medicine every morning, about 30 to 60 minutes before you eat\\u00a0breakfast, to control stomach acid.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nTalk to your doctor before taking the PPI called\\u00a0omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) if you take\\u00a0clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used to prevent\\u00a0heart attacks and strokes. Taking the two drugs may make clopidogrel less effective.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nPPIs may also raise your chances of getting kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spin, and may lead to low magnesium levels. The risk is highest in people who take high dose PPIs for a year or more.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nProkinetics help your stomach empty faster, so you have less acid left behind. Usually you take this medicine before meals and at\\u00a0bedtime.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nYes. If your heartburn isn\\u2019t getting better, your medicines cause side effects you can\\u2019t tolerate, or you have other complications, you may need surgery. It is rare to need surgery for heartburn.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. It can be helpful to keep a journal to note what you eat and drink and when you have heartburn. This will help you and your doctor pinpoint your triggers.\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nIf medicine and lifestyle changes don\\u2019t control your heartburn, you can take one of these tests to find out what's causing the problem:\",\"\\n**pH test**.\\u00a0This measures the acidity of your esophagus. The doctor will either attach a small sensor to your esophagus or place a thin tube down your esophagus.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Endoscopy.**\\u00a0A long, thin tube with a camera and light on the end is put down your esophagus so your doctor can look inside your esophagus and stomach. [Endoscopy](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-endoscopy) can look for problems such as an ulcer or narrowing inside your esophagus.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Barium X-ray**.\\u00a0You\\u2019ll drink a liquid that coats the inside of your digestive tract. Then X-rays are taken, which will allow your doctor to see the outline of your\\u00a0digestive system.\\n\\n\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nHeartburn is usually a minor problem that goes away over time. But if you also have other symptoms, it could be a sign that something more serious is wrong. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if:\",\"## Heartburn/GERD\\n\\nHeartburn doesn\\u2019t affect your\\u00a0heart, but it can feel a lot like the\\u00a0[chest pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/whats-causing-my-chest-pain) that happens during a heart attack. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms along with chest pain, even if you\\u2019re not sure that you\\u2019re having a heart attack:\",\"## Constipation\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s considered a normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. If you are straining when going to the bathroom, you are probably constipated. You may also have hard stools or a feeling that your bowel movement isn\\u2019t complete.\",\"## Constipation\\n\\nOccasional [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation) is common, but if you have less than three bowel movements in a week, see your doctor.\",\"## Constipation\\n\\nIf you are constipated for more than 2 weeks, are losing weight, have [blood in your stool](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/blood-in-stool), or you are having severe pain, see your doctor.

Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which medicine is right for you. Be sure to read labels carefully before taking these medicines. Using some over-the-counter treatments for constipation for more than 2 weeks can make your symptoms worse and may be a sign of something more serious.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nHemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum and the anus, and they can be uncomfortable. They can be either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). Internal [hemorrhoids](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/understanding-hemorrhoids-basics) usually don\\u2019t cause discomfort, though straining to have a bowel movement may cause them to bleed or lead to spasms in the muscles of the rectum, which can be painful. External hemorrhoids itch and may bleed.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. Bleeding can also be a symptom of something more serious.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nConstipation or straining during bowel movements causes most hemorrhoids. You may also have hemorrhoids if you don't get enough fiber in your diet.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nBeing pregnant or overweight can cause hemorrhoids because of the extra pressure on your rectum. Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy can also weaken the muscles of the rectum and anus.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nYou\\u2019re also more likely to get them if you sit for long periods of time. And they're more common as you get older. Other causes include having diabetes, a past rectal surgery, and [colon cancer](https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/understanding-colorectal-cancer-symptoms).\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. They can recommend treatment and make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nYou should also see your doctor if your hemorrhoids haven\\u2019t gotten better with treatment. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in hemorrhoids.\",\"## Hemorrhoids\\n\\nMedications include creams, suppositories, pads, and ointments. Most products contain witch hazel or hydrocortisone, which can help stop the itching and swelling and may ease pain. Most over-the-counter medications should not be used for more than a week. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which is the best option for you.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nDiarrhea is loose, watery stool that sends you to the bathroom more often than usual. When you have diarrhea, you may have [stomach pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments) and cramps or bloating.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nMany things cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, medications, and medical conditions that affect the stomach, intestines, or colon. What you eat can also be a culprit.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nIf you have occasional, mild diarrhea, there is probably no reason for concern. But if it lasts for more than 2 days and hasn\\u2019t improved, you should call your doctor. If your infant or child has diarrhea, call your pediatrician.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nDehydration. Signs of [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) include feeling very thirsty, having a dry mouth or skin, having little or no urine, having dark yellow urine, and feeling weak.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nDrink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks, fruit juice) to keep from getting dehydrated. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and dairy. If you aren\\u2019t nauseated, you can eat plain, bland, low-fiber foods including bananas, plain white rice, toast, and crackers.\",\"## Diarrhea\\n\\nAs long as you don\\u2019t have other symptoms that worry you, you may also try some over-the-counter treatments:\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nFiber is a natural part of plants. There are two types. Both are important and work in different ways.\",\"\\n**Soluble fiber** dissolves in water, turning into a gel. Think of it as a sponge, soaking up fluid. Soluble fiber can help with diarrhea, which happens when there is too much water in your colon. It also slows the emptying of your stomach so you feel fuller longer, which can help you lose weight.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Insoluble fiber** doesn\\u2019t dissolve in water. Think of it as a broom: It helps keep food and waste moving through your body. Because insoluble fiber attracts water in your gut, it makes stools softer and easier to pass. Eating a diet rich in insoluble fiber can help with constipation.\\n\\n\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nWomen should get about 25 grams of fiber per day. Men should get 38 grams.\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nIf you have trouble getting enough fiber from foods, your doctor may suggest you take fiber supplements.\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nWater is essential to good health and normal bowel function. Water also helps keep stools soft but solid and well-formed. Avoid drinking beverages such as coffee or soda if you think they trigger your digestive problems.\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nYour digestive tract is full of different kinds of bacteria. You may think that is a bad thing, but most of the bacteria in your gut are healthy. They break down toxins, help your body make some vitamins, and play a role in keeping you healthy. But when you have too much of some kinds of bacteria, you may get an illness or have unpleasant symptoms.\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nProbiotics are like the healthy bacteria in your body. Eating foods that contain them, or taking probiotic supplements, can help keep a balance of good and bad bacteria in your body.\",\"## How to Fix Digestive Issues\\n\\nPeople with certain conditions shouldn\\u2019t take them, and some probiotics may affect how well your other medications work. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether probioticsupplements are right for you.\",\"## What Are the Treatments for Chronic Pain?\\n\\nThe treatments for chronic pain are as diverse as the causes. From over-the-counter and prescription drugs to mind/body techniques to acupuncture, there are a lot of approaches. But when it comes to treating chronic pain, no single technique is guaranteed to produce complete pain relief. Relief may be found by using a combination of treatment options.\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nMilder forms of pain may be relieved by over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs relieve pain caused by muscle aches and stiffness, and additionally, NSAIDs reduce inflammation (swelling and irritation). Topical pain relievers are also available, such as creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin in order to relieve pain and inflammation from sore muscles and arthritis.\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nIf over-the-counter drugs do not provide relief, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications, such as muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs (such as [diazepam](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6306/diazepam-oral/details) \\\\[ [Valium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11116/valium-oral/details)\\\\]), antidepressants (like [duloxetine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-91490-404/duloxetine-oral/duloxetine-oral/details) \\\\[ [Cymbalta](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-91491/cymbalta-oral/details)\\\\] for musculoskeletal pain), prescription [NSAIDs](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/anti-inflammatory-drugs) such as [celecoxib](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16849/celebrex-oral/details) (Celebrex), or a short course of stronger painkillers (such as codeine, fentanyl \\\\[ [Actiq](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16877/actiq-buccal/details), [Duragesic](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14008/duragesic-transdermal/details)\\\\], [oxycodone and\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nacetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-2796/oxycodone-acetaminophen-oral/details) ( [Percocet](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-7277/percocet-oral/details), [Roxicet](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16080/roxicet-oral/details), [Tylox](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14993/tylox-oral/details)) or hydrocodone and [acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-362/acetaminophen-oral/details) ( [Lorcet](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-32701/lorcet-10-650-oral/details), [Lortab](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-78569/lortab-elixir-oral/details), and [Vicodin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3459/vicodin-oral/details)). A limited number of steroid injections at the site of a joint problem can reduce swelling and inflammation. An epidural might be given for spinal stenosis or lower back pain.\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nIn July 2015, the FDA asked that both prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs strengthen their warning labels to indicate the potential risk of [heart attacks](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-heart-attacks) and strokes. The risk increases with higher doses of the drugs. In addition, there is also the possibility of developing bleeding stomach ulcers.\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nSometimes, a group of nerves that causes pain to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with local medication. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block. Although many kinds of nerve blocks exist, this treatment cannot always be used. Often blocks are not possible, are too dangerous, or are not the best treatment for the problem. Your doctor can advise you as to whether this treatment is appropriate for you.\",\"## Drug Therapy: Nonprescription and Prescription\\n\\nPatient-controlled analgesia ( [PCA](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pca)) is another method of pain control. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient is able to self-administer a premeasured dose of pain medicine infused with opioids. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain in\\u00a0post-traumatic or post-surgical pain as well as terminal cancer pain..\",\"## Trigger Point Injections\\n\\nTrigger point injection is a procedure used to treat painful areas of muscle that contain trigger points, or knots of muscle that form when muscles do not relax. During this procedure, a healthcare professional, using a small needle, injects a [local anesthetic](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-to-know-about-local-anesthesia) that sometimes includes a steroid into a trigger point (sterile salt water is sometimes injected). With the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is alleviated. Usually, a brief course of treatment will result in sustained relief.\",\"## Trigger Point Injections\\n\\nTrigger point injection is used to treat muscle pain in the arms, legs, lower back, and neck. In addition, this approach has been used to treat fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome (chronic pain involving tissue that surrounds muscle) that does not respond to other treatments.\",\"## Trigger Point Injections\\n\\n[Onabotulinumtoxina](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-153463/onabotulinumtoxina-injection/details)\\u00a0(Botox) is a toxin that blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. It can also be injected to alleviate chronic [migraine headaches](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-migraines). The procedure involves multiple injections around the head and neck every 12 weeks and may alleviate pain for up to three months.\",\"## Surgical Implants\\n\\nWhen standard medicines and [physical therapy](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-physical-therapy) fail to offer adequate pain relief, you may be a candidate for a surgical implant to help you control pain. When they are used, which is rare,\\u00a0there are two main types of implants to control pain:\",\"## TENS\\n\\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, more commonly referred to as [TENS](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/tens-for-chronic-pain), uses electrical stimulation to diminish pain. During the procedure, low-voltage electrical current is delivered through electrodes that are placed on the skin near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates the nerves in an affected area and sends signals to the brain that \\\"scramble\\\" normal pain signals. TENS is not painful and may be an effective therapy to mask pain such as diabetic neuropathy. However, TENS for chronic low back pain is not effective and cannot be recommended, says the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).\",\"## Bioelectric Therapy\\n\\nBioelectric therapy relieves pain by blocking pain messages to the brain. Bioelectric therapy also prompts the body to produce chemicals called endorphins (endorphins are also\\u00a0released by exercise) that decrease or eliminate painful sensations by blocking the message of pain from being delivered to the brain.\",\"## Bioelectric Therapy\\n\\nBioelectric therapy can be used to treat many chronic and acute conditions causing pain, such as back pain, muscle pain, headaches and migraines, arthritis, [TMJ disorder](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/temporomandibular-disorders-tmd), diabetic neuropathy, and scleroderma.\",\"## Bioelectric Therapy\\n\\nBioelectric therapy is effective in providing temporary pain control, but it should be used as part of a total pain management program. When used along with conventional pain-relieving medications, bioelectric treatment may allow pain sufferers to reduce their dose of some pain relievers by up to 50%.\",\"## Physical Therapy\\n\\nPhysical therapy helps to relieve pain by using special techniques that improve movement and function impaired by an injury or disability. Along with employing stretching, strengthening, and pain-relieving techniques, a [physical therapist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-a-physical-therapist) may use, among other things, TENS to aid treatment.\",\"## Exercise\\n\\nAlthough resting for short periods can alleviate pain, too much rest may actually increase pain and put you at greater risk of injury when you again attempt movement. Research has shown that regular exercise can diminish pain in the long term by improving muscle tone, strength, and flexibility. Exercise may also cause a release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Some exercises are easier for certain chronic pain sufferers to perform than others; try swimming, biking, walking, rowing, and [yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/the-health-benefits-of-yoga).\",\"## Psychological Treatment\\n\\nWhen you are in pain, you may have feelings of anger, sadness, hopelessness, and/or despair. Pain can alter your personality, disrupt your sleep, and interfere with your work and relationships. In turn, [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/detecting-depression) and anxiety, lack of sleep, and feelings of stress can all make pain worse. Psychological treatment provides safe, nondrug methods that can treat your pain directly by reducing high levels of physiological stress that often aggravate pain. Psychological treatment also helps improve the indirect consequences of pain by helping you learn how to cope with the many problems associated with pain.\",\"## Psychological Treatment\\n\\nA large part of psychological treatment for pain is education, helping patients acquire skills to manage a very difficult problem.\",\"## Alternative Therapies\\n\\nIn the past decade, many people have found relief for their pain in mind-body therapies, acupuncture, and some nutritional supplements. Others use [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits), chiropractic and osteopathic (bone) manipulation therapies, therapeutic touch, certain herbal therapies, and dietary approaches to alleviate pain. However, there is little if any scientific evidence supporting these therapies for pain relief.\",\"## Mind-Body Therapies\\n\\nMind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind's ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to [chronic pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/understanding-pain-management-chronic-pain).\",\"## Mind-Body Therapies\\n\\nVisualization may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image.\",\"## Mind-Body Therapies\\n\\nAnother approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it.\",\"## Mind-Body Therapies\\n\\n[Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback](https://www.webmd.com/brain/emg-and-nerve-conduction-study) may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area.\",\"## Mind-Body Therapies\\n\\n[Relaxation techniques](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-management) such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body.\",\"## Acupuncture\\n\\nAcupuncture is thought to decrease pain by increasing the release of endorphins, chemicals that block pain. Many acu-points are near nerves. When stimulated, these nerves cause a dull ache or feeling of fullness in the muscle. The stimulated muscle sends a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), causing the release of endorphins that block the message of pain from being delivered to the brain.\",\"## Acupuncture\\n\\nAcupuncture may be useful as an accompanying treatment for many pain-related conditions, including headache, low back pain, menstrual cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, [fibromyalgia](https://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/what-is-fibromyalgia), osteoarthritis (especially of the knee), and myofascial pain. Acupuncture also may be an acceptable alternative to or may be included as part of a comprehensive pain management program.\",\"## Chiropractic Treatment and Massage\\n\\nChiropractic treatment is the most common nonsurgical treatment for back pain. Improvements of people undergoing chiropractic manipulations were noted in some trials. However, the treatment's effectiveness in treating chronic back and neck pain has not been supported by compelling evidence from the majority of clinical trials. Further studies are currently assessing the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pain management.\",\"## Chiropractic Treatment and Massage\\n\\nOsteopathic doctors, those with a \\\"D.O.\\\" after their names, are also trained in bone manipulation techniques similar to that of [chiropractors](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/chiropractor).\",\"## Chiropractic Treatment and Massage\\n\\nMassage is being increasingly used by people suffering from pain, mostly to manage chronic back and neck problems. Massage can reduce stress and relieve tension by enhancing blood flow. This treatment also can reduce the presence of substances that may generate and sustain pain. Available data suggest that massage therapy, like chiropractic manipulations, holds considerable promise for managing [back pain](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/home-relief-for-low-back-pain). However, it is not possible to draw final conclusions regarding the effectiveness of massage to treat pain because of the shortcomings of available studies.\",\"## Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing\\n\\nTherapeutic touch and reiki healing are thought to help activate the self-healing processes of an individual and therefore reduce pain. Although these so-called \\\"energy-based\\\" techniques do not require actual physical contact, they do involve close physical proximity between practitioner and patient.\",\"## Therapeutic Touch and Reiki Healing\\n\\nIn the past few years, several reviews evaluated published studies on the efficacy of these healing approaches to ease pain and [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/anxiety-symptoms-signs) and improve health. Although several studies showed beneficial effects with no significant adverse side effects, the limitations of some of these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed before these approaches for pain treatment can be recommended.\",\"## Nutritional Supplements\\n\\nDietary supplements, such as fish oils and SAMe, also show some evidence of benefit, although more research is needed.\",\"## Herbal Remedies\\n\\nIt has been difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of herbs, though there are a few, such as white willow bark, devil\\u2019s claw, cat\\u2019s claw, [ginger](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/ginger-uses-and-risks), and turmeric, that have some evidence supporting their use. If you decide to use herbal preparations to better manage your pain, tell your doctor: Some herbs may interact with drugs you are receiving for pain or other conditions and may harm your health.\",\"## Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain\\n\\nSome people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or eating plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation.\",\"## Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain\\n\\nA mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not methodologically strong. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from [osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-basics).\",\"## Dietary Approaches to Treating Pain\\n\\nStill, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment.\",\"## Things to Consider\\n\\nAlternative therapies are not always benign. As mentioned, some herbal therapies can interact with other medications you may be taking. Always talk to your doctor before trying an alternative approach and be sure to tell all your doctors what [alternative treatments](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pain-management-alternative-therapy) you are using.\",\"## Other Options: Pain Clinics\\n\\nMany people suffering from chronic pain are able to gain some measure of control over it by trying many of the above treatments on their own. But for some, no matter what treatment approach they try, they still suffer from debilitating pain. For them, pain clinics -- special care centers devoted exclusively to dealing with intractable pain -- may be the answer. Some pain clinics are associated with hospitals and others are private; in either case, both inpatient and outpatient treatment are usually available.\",\"## Other Options: Pain Clinics\\n\\nPain clinics generally employ a multidisciplinary approach, involving physicians, [psychologists](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-psychologist), and physical therapists. The patient as well should take an active role in their own treatment. The aim in many cases is not only to alleviate pain but also to teach the chronic sufferer how to come to terms with pain and function in spite of it.\",\"## Other Options: Pain Clinics\\n\\nVarious studies have shown as much as 50% improvement in pain reduction for chronic pain sufferers after visiting a pain clinic, and most people learn to cope better and can resume normal activities.\",\"## What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)?\\n\\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious virus that affects your respiratory system. It spreads easily and leads to cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose and cough.\",\"## What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)?\\n\\nMost people with RSV have mild symptoms that go away on their own in a week or two. But RSV can lead to serious complications, especially for babies, [older adults](https://www.webmd.com/lung/rsv-treatment-older-adults), and people with certain conditions.\",\"## What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)?\\n\\nIf you have RSV and you can\\u2019t breathe well or you\\u2019re dehydrated, you may need to go to the hospital. You may need IV fluids, oxygen, or ventilation (which helps with your air flow).\",\"## What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)?\\n\\nIn the U.S., RSV season begins in the fall, peaks in the winter, and starts to slow down at the end of spring. But it varies from year to year.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nWith RSV, you may develop more serious symptoms. When RSV goes into your lower respiratory tract, it may lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is when the small airways that lead to your lungs get inflamed.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nIt's possible to have RSV without a fever as well. RSV can also cause a headache, an ear infection, eye discharge, or hives.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nIf you have mucus with RSV, colors to watch for include yellow, green, or gray. Call your doctor if you see these colors.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nYoung babies have a high risk of severe RSV, so if your baby is less than 6 months old, seems sick, and has signs of RSV, call your doctor.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nAn RSV cough is usually dry. If it\\u2019s a serious case of RSV, the cough may sound more severe.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nChildren with RSV may develop croup, or a cough and a sore, scratchy throat. If you have severe RSV, you may develop bronchiolitis, which may make you cough more.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nWhen your immune system fights a virus like RSV, you may develop a rash. But rashes are often caused by something else.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nWith an RSV rash, you may notice bumps, blotches, or spots on your skin. They may appear anywhere on your body and may spread to other areas.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nA rash isn\\u2019t something you need to worry about with RSV. It\\u2019ll likely go away in a few days without treatment.\",\"## RSV Symptoms\\n\\nYou may develop RSV symptoms about 4-6 days after you\\u2019re infected. They can show up in different stages or all at one time. Mild symptoms of RSV may go away on their own in a week or two. But you may still have a cough for a few more weeks.\",\"## RSV in Babies\\n\\nRSV is common, even in babies. Most children get it at least once by the time they\\u2019re 2 years old. Since RSV is very contagious, babies who are in child care or have siblings who are in child care or school are more likely to get RSV.\",\"## RSV in Babies\\n\\nWhile babies may have mild cold-like symptoms from RSV, they have more risk of serious complications.\",\"## RSV in Babies\\n\\nYour baby can get RSV if they come into contact with fluid from another infected person's mouth or nose. They may breathe in droplets from someone's sneeze or cough. Or, they may touch something that has fluids from an infected person and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.\",\"## RSV in Babies\\n\\n[Infants](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/cm/infant-rsv-complications) have a higher risk of a severe or life-threatening infection. Premature infants and babies who are 6 months and younger have the highest risk.\",\"## RSV in Babies\\n\\nIf your baby is less than 6 months old and has signs of RSV, call your pediatrician.\",\"## RSV in Adults\\n\\nAdults often get RSV. The risk of problems is lower than it is for infants and older adults.\",\"## RSV in Adults\\n\\nIf you have certain health conditions, like heart disease or lung disease, you may have a higher risk of RSV leading to other health problems.\",\"## RSV in Adults\\n\\nFor adults, RSV symptoms are similar to typical cold-like symptoms, such as a congested or runny nose, headache, or a sore throat. They may be mild and go away on their own.\",\"## RSV in Adults\\n\\nAfter you've been exposed to RSV, your symptoms will usually show up after 4-6 days. These symptoms will usually last 2-8 days. It typically takes adults 1-2 weeks to fully recover unless you have more serious issues come up.\",\"## RSV in Children and Teens\\n\\nRSV is common in children and teens but less likely to lead to problems.\",\"## RSV in Children and Teens\\n\\nYour child or teen may have a higher risk of complications if they have a weakened immune system from things like cancer or chemotherapy treatment.\",\"## RSV in Children and Teens\\n\\nThe risk is also higher for children with neuromuscular disorders like muscular dystrophy and conditions like congenital heart disease and chronic lung disease.\",\"## RSV in Children and Teens\\n\\nOlder children often have mild, cold-like symptoms from RSV like the ones listed above. They may have other symptoms like an ear infection, eye redness, eye irritation, or eye discharge.\",\"## RSV in Children and Teens\\n\\nIf your child or teen has severe RSV, common symptoms may include a cough and a sore, scratchy throat.\",\"## RSV in Older Adults\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an older adult, RSV can be more dangerous. If you\\u2019re 75 or older, your doctor may recommend a single dose of the RSV vaccine to [prevent problems](https://www.webmd.com/lung/rsv-delaying-care-dangers). Experts also recommend a single dose of the vaccine for adults 60 to 74 years old and up who are at high risk for severe RSV disease.\",\"## RSV in Older Adults\\n\\nIn addition to the typical symptoms of RSV, older adults are at risk for more severe issues including pneumonia or worsened symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\",\"## RSV Transmission\\n\\nRSV travels on small droplets through the air. It enters your body through your eyes, nose, or mouth.\",\"## RSV Transmission\\n\\nRSV may live for hours on hard surfaces like countertops and toys. It has a shorter lifespan on soft surfaces like tissues.\",\"## RSV Transmission\\n\\nWhen you get RSV, you may be contagious for about 3-8 days. You\\u2019re most contagious during the first week, but you may be contagious 1-2 days before you notice any symptoms.\",\"## RSV Transmission\\n\\nBabies and people with weak immune systems may be contagious longer, up to 4 weeks after symptoms go away.\",\"## RSV Transmission\\n\\nThe incubation period, or the time it takes to notice symptoms after being exposed to the virus, can be anywhere from 1 to 10 days.\",\"## RSV Diagnosis\\n\\nTo find out if you have RSV, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They may listen to your lungs, check your blood oxygen level, and do a swab test on your mucus.\",\"## RSV Diagnosis\\n\\nYour doctor probably won\\u2019t do a test for RSV unless you or your child has high risk factors or signs of severe RSV.\",\"## RSV Diagnosis\\n\\nIf so, they may take a sample of nose fluids by using a cotton swab or bulb syringe. They\\u2019ll test it for RSV.\",\"## RSV Diagnosis\\n\\nYou can also buy an at-home RSV test. With this test, you'll swab the inside of your nostril and send it into a lab for testing. You can get this test without a prescription.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nRSV symptoms are similar to the common cold. You'll most likely start to notice cold symptoms 1 to 3 days after being exposed to the virus. There are a few things that separate RSV from a cold:\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nIf you're wheezing, it's more likely that you have RSV, as this symptom isn't as common with a mild cold.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nWhile a cold and RSV both last for a week or two, RSV symptoms tend to get worse over time unlike a cold.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nYour doctor probably won\\u2019t try to figure out whether you or your child has a cold or RSV unless you have a high risk or signs of severe RSV.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nSymptoms of RSV and the flu may be similar, but RSV usually stays in your upper respiratory tract. If you or your child has diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, it\\u2019s a sign of something else, like flu or COVID-19.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nAnother sign that it\\u2019s the flu instead of RSV is if the sickness starts with a high fever. RSV usually starts with cold-like symptoms.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nWhile they're possible with RSV, you're \\u00a0more likely to have body aches and fatigue with the flu.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nFlu symptoms tend to pop up 1 to 4 days after you're exposed to the virus. They'll last around 5 to 7 days. But if you've had the flu vaccine, they may last for a shorter amount of time and be less severe.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nThe symptoms of RSV and COVID can be alike. But RSV usually only affects your upper respiratory tract. It's still possible with RSV, but COVID is more likely to cause difficulty breathing, fatigue, and a sore throat. RSV is more likely to cause wheezing, while that's less common with COVID.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nIf you or your child has gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, it may be COVID.\",\"## How to Know If It\\u2019s RSV, Cold, Flu, or COVID\\n\\nYour COVID symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you come into contact with virus. They usually last one to two weeks. But severe cases can have symptoms that last up to months.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nSome cases of RSV can be prevented through a [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/lung/rsv-vaccines). There are two vaccines: Abrysvo and Arexvy.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nExperts found that RSV vaccines help lower the risk of disease in people 60 years old and up by 80-90% in the first season after a vaccine. Arexvy was 77-83% effective in stopping RSV-related hospitalization in people 60 and up. Abrysvo was 73-79% successful in doing the same.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nAdults can get the RSV vaccine at any time. But it's best to get it in the late summer and early fall before RSV begins to spread around.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nThe protection you get from a vaccine goes down over time, but it still offers protection against severe RSV illness for at least 2 years.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nWhile there's no RSV vaccine for babies, your infant or young child can get immunized with RSV monoclonal antibodies. Your baby can get this even if you've already had the RSV vaccination while pregnant with them.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nExperts recommend one dose of nirsevimab for infants under 8 months who were born right before or are going into their first RSV season. They also recommend a single dose of nirsevimab for infants and children 8-19 months who are entering their second RSV season and have a higher risk of severe RSV disease.\",\"## RSV Vaccine\\n\\nAnother RSV preventative antibody called palivizumab is available for children 24 months and younger who have a condition that puts them at high risk for severe RSV disease. Your baby's doctor will give it to them once a month during RSV season. They should get their first dose before the season starts.\",\"## RSV Prevention\\n\\nIf you or your baby is sick with RSV, you can wear a mask to help lower the chances that you spread the virus.\",\"## RSV Prevention\\n\\nWhile you don't need to quarantine with RSV, it's smart to stay home from school or work until you feel better. This will also help you avoid spreading the virus to other people.\",\"## RSV Treatment\\n\\nIf your child has trouble breathing, your doctor may recommend an RSV nebulizer with albuterol to help them breathe better.\",\"## RSV Treatment\\n\\nIf your baby or toddler has RSV, they may need to go to the hospital so doctors can watch them closely and give them treatment for breathing problems or dehydration.\",\"## RSV Treatment\\n\\nIn most cases, you don\\u2019t need a special treatment like RSV medication. You can use over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to treat a fever. Staying hydrated helps, so try to drink plenty of water.\",\"## RSV Treatment\\n\\nOnly 2% of people with RSV need to go to the hospital for a more serious treatment.\",\"## RSV Home Remedies\\n\\nIf your baby has RSV, they may not want to drink anything. Try to offer fluids often, in small amounts.\",\"## RSV Complications\\n\\nRSV may lead to complications, especially in young babies, older adults, and people with other high-risk conditions.\",\"\\n**Pneumonia.** This infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in one or both of your lungs. It can lead to cough with phlegm, fever, difficulty breathing, and chills.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Bronchiolitis.** This is a common lung infection that affects children and babies. It leads to swelling, irritation, and mucus in the airways of your lungs.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Middle ear infection.** This infection affects the air-filled space behind your eardrum. Tubes that run from your ear to the back of your throat become blocked and swollen. This causes mucus to build-up in the middle of your ear.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Asthma.** This condition causes your airways to become inflamed and narrowed at certain moments. It can make it harder for air to move out of your airways when you breathe.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Bronchitis.** This is when the airways that lead to your lungs become inflamed and fill up with mucus. It can cause a constant cough that may last 2 or more weeks.\\n\\n\",\"## RSV Complications\\n\\nIn some cases, you or your child may need to go to the hospital for severe cases on RSV.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nRSV may get serious quickly. If it spreads, it may lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis. When RSV leads to lung inflammation, it may be very serious, especially for young infants and toddlers, older adults, and people who are immunocompromised or have chronic heart or lung disease.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nYes. RSV is very contagious, and kids may bring it home from school or child care. You can also get RSV if your baby has it and you kiss their face.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nYou may notice RSV symptoms about 2-5 days after you\\u2019ve been exposed to it. The first stage is mild and feels like a cold. Then it may move into the lungs and lead to coughing or wheezing. Then it may lead to respiratory disease, which you need to be hospitalized for.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nThere\\u2019s no specific treatment to get rid of RSV quickly. It usually takes 1-2 weeks to go away. Staying hydrated may help.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nYou can use over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers to help with pain and fever. But there\\u2019s no specific RSV medication.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nYes, RSV usually goes away on its own. But if there are complications, you or your child may need to go to the hospital for special treatment.\",\"## RSV FAQs\\n\\nWhile some cases may go away with time, you may need over-the-counter medications or other treatments to help you feel better. Rest and self care are also important to cure a case of RSV.\",\"\\n**Amino Acids**. The building blocks that make up proteins. Humans need 21 different amino acids to function properly. Some are made by the body. Others, called essential amino acids, must be obtained from foods.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Antioxidant**. Substances, like [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/vitamin-expert) A, C, E, and beta-carotene, that protect your body from the damage of oxidation caused by free radicals.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Botanicals**.

Oxidation can damage cell membranes and interfere with a cell's regulatory systems, but it is also part of our normal-functioning immune system.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Phytochemicals**. Compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other plants that can be health-protecting. Phytochemicals (sometimes called [phytonutrients](https://www.webmd.com/diet/phytonutrients-faq)) include beta-carotene, lycopene, and [resveratrol](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/resveratrol-supplements).\\n\\n\",\"\\n[**Prenatal Vitamins**](https://www.webmd.com/baby/prenatal-vitamins). Specially formulated multivitamins that ensure a pregnant woman gets enough essential micronutrients. Prenatal supplements generally contain more [folic acid](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8334/folic+acid+oral/details), iron, and [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-gourmet-calcium) than standard adult supplements.\",\"\\n**Recommended Dietary Allowance** (RDA). The amount of [nutrients](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/slideshow-missing-nutrients) needed daily to prevent the development of disease in most people.

A nonprofit authority that sets standards and certifies supplements that meet certain quality, strength, and purity standards, some of which are called the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Many supplements carry the USP symbol on their label.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Vitamins**. Naturally found in plants and animals, vitamins are vital to growth, energy, and nerve function. There are two types of vitamins used by the body to support health: fat-soluble and water-soluble.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Water-Soluble Vitamin**. Water-soluble vitamins like B-6, C, and folic acid are easily absorbed by the body. Your body uses the vitamins it needs, then excretes excess water-soluble vitamins in urine. Because excess amounts of these vitamins are not stored in the body, there is less risk of toxicity than with fat-soluble vitamins but a greater risk of deficiency.\\n\\n\",\"\\nBy using this site, you signify your assent to these Terms and Conditions.

On tough days, it can feel like you're at the mercy of your body. But symptom-heavy days can be opportunities to tap into creativity and mindfulness.\",\"\\nEmbracing at-home creativity is my way of coping. It helps me stay productive, mentally engaged, and, most importantly, connected to a sense of joy.\",\"\\nFor me, creativity is a form of therapy. When my muscles feel like they\\u2019re on strike, crafting is my go-to escape. One of my favorites is making book nooks\\u2014those miniature, intricate scenes that nestle between books on a shelf. The process of designing and assembling them transports me to another world, where my imagination runs wild, even though my body can\\u2019t.\",\"\\nI also channel my inner kid and build LEGO models, which give me the satisfaction of following steps and achieving something. Plus. it\\u2019s an excuse to buy toys as an adult without judgment!\",\"\\nI\\u2019ve also tried macram\\u00e9, framed prints, painted pottery, and dabbled in diamond and scratch art. Crafting is a gift when your body needs rest but your brain is begging for something to do.\",\"\\nHonestly, it\\u2019s magical how something as simple as creating can make you feel grounded on the days you\\u2019re feeling far from it.\",\"\\nWhile I don\\u2019t dive into jewelry or candle making, knitting, or sewing, these can be just as fulfilling. They offer a chance to make something beautiful with your own hands from the comfort of your sofa. They\\u2019re great options when MG leaves you with little energy to spare.\",\"\\nIn addition to my crafty adventures, writing is an essential way I process and reflect on life with MG. I write about my condition, experiences, and thoughts. It helps me make sense of everything. But writing doesn\\u2019t have to be confined to journaling. Whether it\\u2019s writing a blog, poetry, or a novel (hey, might as well dream big!), putting words on paper is an emotional release. You\\u2019re creating something meaningful, even if you\\u2019re not physically active.\",\"\\nMusic is another creative outlet. I had a ukulele for a while, but it wasn\\u2019t until I was homebound during tough MG days that I learned to play. I used the Yousician app to guide me, which is perfect because it allows me to learn at my own pace, without the pressure of formal lessons.\",\"\\nMusic is incredibly uplifting. Learning an instrument, even if it\\u2019s just a few simple chords, gives me something new to focus on when I can't leave the house.\",\"\\nLearning a language or a new skill, like coding, could be an exciting and productive way to challenge your mind. Podcasting is another fantastic option. I didn\\u2019t create my own, but I spent a lot of time listening to self-development and mindset podcasts, which help me stay motivated and mentally strong during my toughest days.\",\"\\nThere's something about hearing other people's stories of resilience that helps you find your own. Audiobooks are also a great companion, allowing me to absorb new ideas without the strain of reading.\",\"\\nEven when I\\u2019m not feeling my best, tidying up around the house or going through old belongings is surprisingly therapeutic. Sorting through old clothes, getting rid of things I no longer need, and even selling some items help me feel productive, even if I can\\u2019t leave the house.\",\"\\nThere\\u2019s a unique satisfaction that comes from decluttering, especially when living with a condition like MG, where so much feels out of your control. For added creativity, you could turn to upcycling old items, turning something worn out into something fresh and new.\",\"\\nOn a more introspective note, I turn to meditation and yoga as ways to connect with myself and calm my mind. On days when I\\u2019m not physically up for much, sitting quietly and focusing on my breath has been a lifesaver.\",\"\\nYoga, when my muscles allow it, is a way to feel in tune with my body, even when it feels like my muscles are playing a game of \\u201cwho can be the weakest today?\\u201d These practices are all about mindfulness, which is invaluable in helping me manage the mental side of living with MG.\",\"\\nAnd then there\\u2019s cooking and baking. Thanks to my autoimmune condition, I had to experiment in the kitchen more than I ever thought possible. When you want to make something that tastes good but it\\u2019s gluten-free, dairy-free, and low in inflammatory properties, you basically become a kitchen scientist\\u2014minus the lab coat. But with plenty of failed experiments.\",\"\\nExperimenting with new recipes gives me a creative outlet that\\u2019s both challenging and rewarding. Plus, the end result is nourishing my body in the best way possible.\",\"\\nLiving with MG isn\\u2019t easy, but it\\u2019s given me the opportunity to rediscover creativity in ways I never thought possible. Whether crafting, writing, playing music, organizing, or cooking (mostly) edible meals, these activities help me cope on hard days.\",\"\\nWhatever your creative outlets are, the key is finding what brings you joy and makes you feel a little more in control of your world. Because when you live with\\u00a0 MG, those small moments are worth everything.\",\"## [What I've Gained from Living with MG](https://blogs.webmd.com/myasthenia-gravis/20241008/what-ive-gained-from-living-with-mg \\\"\\\")\\n\\nLiving with myasthenia gravis (MG) isn\\u2019t something I anticipated. When I first received my diagnosis, my world tilted on its axis.\",\"## [The Power of Pets in Living With MG](https://blogs.webmd.com/myasthenia-gravis/20240924/how-pets-add-to-your-life-with-mg \\\"\\\")\\n\\nThere's a special kind of comfort that comes from being around animals, especially when you face the unpredictability of Myasthenia Gravis (MG).\",\"\\nWebMD understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our users.

Some prefer to struggle in silence and battle their hardship alone. Others feel comfortable enough to be vocal about their struggles and lean on their loved ones for support. Unfortunately for me, sickle cell disease has allowed me to experience both of these approaches.\",\"\\nI\\u2019ve had times when I\\u2019ve been extremely vulnerable and open about how difficult my life has been over the years, and in return, I\\u2019ve gotten unwavering support.\\u00a0But there have also been moments when I\\u2019ve bottled up my emotions and stress\\u00a0because of fear of being misunderstood or because I didn't want to hear comments like \\u201cIt could all be so much worse,\\u201d and \\u201cYou\\u2019re being dramatic; how bad could things really be?\\u201d The first scenario is obviously more comforting, but sometimes that approach can lead to anxiety and overthinking about being too emotional, or it could cause fear of oversharing with others.\",\"\\nNo one ever wants to be in a situation where they\\u2019ve been completely transparent about their feelings and\\u00a0\\u2013 in that moment \\u2013 they were comforted, but later they are reminded of what someone has done for them.\\u00a0 Expressing my sadness is challenging enough.\\u00a0But when I\\u2019ve realized favors have been counted between me and someone I\\u2019ve trusted with those feelings, it causes an even deeper apprehension to share things and seek help from others.\",\"\\nAfter experiencing the hurt associated with your times of distress being thrown back into your face, it\\u2019s quite easy to decide to be more private in the future. However, withholding so many emotions and carrying the weight of having health issues alone is not ideal either. We are human and it's natural for us to search for support. But when your village is not meeting those expectations, it drives a wedge between your relationships. Whether these expectations include someone close to you visiting you in the hospital or simply checking in on you after having a hard day, it can be hurtful to not have people showing up for you in the way you feel you deserve.\",\"\\nOver the years I\\u2019ve also learned that putting expectations on your loved ones without informing them that you\\u2019ve done so can be a major way to reel in conflict within all your relationships. I\\u2019ve been in situations where my closest friend at the time didn't see the importance of being present with me during times I\\u2019ve been sick and found it easier to avoid me\\u00a0all together when I went into crisis. However, I\\u2019ve also had a former friend drive me to the hospital themselves and show immense support, but later mention these kind gestures to me during disagreements. These two instances alone have encouraged me to go back and forth with my thoughts and how much I decide to share with the people in my life, for the satisfaction of not being pitied or to limit the chances of my friends one day keeping score.\",\"\\nAlthough living with\\u00a0sickle cell\\u00a0disease has sometimes benefited me by helping me realize who my true friends are more quickly than I could have known without it, I\\u2019ve still crossed paths with amazing people who have genuinely cared for me in my times of need. I\\u2019ve met complete strangers who were so inspired by my life that it led them to be supportive in any way necessary. It\\u2019s such a peaceful feeling when others see you and stand with you in times of darkness. Some want recognition, but oftentimes others just want to be a confidant and encourage me to embrace my story and share it with the world. I\\u2019m thankful for those individuals because they\\u2019ve helped me reshape the perception I had for my own life.\",\"\\nNow as an adult, I realize that everyone will come across a time where they must fight their own battles.\\u00a0Just because mine constantly involves fighting my illness, it does not make me more flawed in comparison\\u00a0to others. If living with\\u00a0sickle\\u00a0cell\\u00a0disease has taught me anything, it\\u2019s that comparing yourself to others is the true thief of joy.\",\"\\nInstead of watching my classmates get better grades than\\u00a0I did because I missed class often and they were able to have perfect attendance, I found resources to help accommodate me as a student and increase my success.\\u00a0After noticing how beneficial reaching out for assistance could be, I became more honest about my circumstances and vocal about what I needed to ensure I had the same opportunities as my peers. Asking for help as a student was essential in making sure I was being treated with equity\\u00a0vs. equality during moments when my illness was a hindrance. Although it took many years to feel comfortable sharing my health conditions with my teachers in elementary school and high school, by the time I was in college I was a master at self-advocacy in educational environments. If I had any advice for someone struggling with sickle\\u00a0cell\\u00a0disease, it\\u00a0would be that there\\u2019s no award for being \\u201cthe toughest,\\u201d so suffering in silence even though help is accessible is never considered\",\"\\nSome of the most supportive people in my life have come when I took a chance on expressing myself to them.\\u00a0I\\u2019ve\\u00a0been completely surprised by how others have responded to\\u00a0learning about my health. Sometimes the person I was most afraid to ask for help has been the most helpful and\\u00a0the easiest for me to lean on. I\\u2019ve had college professors and deans of students pause their entire day to accompany me to the emergency room or comfort me while I shed a few tears in their office about having dozens of missing assignments to complete. In addition to supporting me emotionally, they\\u2019ve also assisted me in brainstorming solutions or helped me have difficult conversations with people lacking the same empathy they\\u2019ve consistently shown.\",\"\\nOverall, I\\u2019m an advocate for letting others lend you their strength because I\\u2019ve had amazing opportunities arise in my life from sharing my truth and getting the\\u00a0help I needed. I\\u2019ve been blessed enough to have close friends and family spend New Year\\u2019s Eve with me in the hospital to make me happier and avoid entering the new year depressed. Having too much pride to ask for help limits privacy, but it does not alleviate the struggles of battling hard times alone or increase any of your resilience in the eyes of others.\",\"## [Life With Sickle Cell Disease](https://blogs.webmd.com/sickle-cell-disease/20240813/life-with-sickle-cell-disease \\\"\\\")\\n\\nLife With Sickle Cell Disease Life with sickle cell disease has not ever been an easy journey for me.

Most of these are diseases we\\u2019ve never heard of \\u2013 talk about a steep learning curve \\u2013 but one thing we\\u2019re all too familiar with is ringworm.\",\"\\nLet\\u2019s get one thing straight right off the bat \\u2013 \\u201cringworm\\u201d is not caused by a worm. Despite its name, ringworm actually refers to a superficial _fungal_ infection. Many different causative species can affect all ages and various body sites, including your torso, extremities, groin folds, face, and scalp (which can be extra tricky to treat. More on that later). Tinea infections are classified and named based on the body site affected:\",\"\\nTinea flourishes in warm, humid climates and is spread via direct skin contact with an infected person or animal. Additional risk factors include wearing enclosed shoes or boots (think sweaty feet), using communal spaces such as showers or locker rooms, and having a compromised immune system.\",\"\\nRingworm on the body typically appears round (hence the \\u201cring\\u201d in \\u201cringworm), shaped like an egg, in semicircular pink or red patches. There tends to be a prominent, elevated border, which may be a deeper red or purple color. There is often central clearing, in which the middle of the rash is significantly lighter in color. Lesions are scaly, may have a bumpy appearance to them, and are often itchy.\",\"\\nIn body folds, such as between the toes or in groin folds, the affected area may appear macerated, meaning the skin appears moist and softened, often with a white or wrinkly quality. On your scalp, ringworm may cause scaling, flaking, pus bumps, and can even lead to broken hairs and hair loss. You may also have swollen lymph nodes.\",\"\\nRingworm can be isolated or widespread. The number of lesions and areas on your body involved will determine the treatment recommended by your doctor.\",\"\\nA classic, textbook case of tinea may be diagnosed visually without diagnostic testing. However, it may be confused with some lookalike rashes in widespread or atypical cases. Some of these lookalikes include eczema, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, syphilis, bacterial infections, and other less common skin conditions such as granuloma annulare or cutaneous lupus.\",\"\\nTinea may be suspected based on a simple visual inspection. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may scrape the scaly part of the lesion with a blade, put it on a glass slide, and look at it under the microscope. A positive sample will show long, branching filaments called hyphae, which indicate the presence of fungal organisms.\",\"\\nAlternatively, a fungal culture may be performed. This is a diagnostic test in which a skin sample is collected and sent to grow under controlled conditions in a microbiology lab. A fungal culture may be used to determine the specific type of fungus causing the rash. This knowledge can help your doctor select the most appropriate antifungal medication, as some fungal species have developed resistance to commonly prescribed drugs.\",\"\\nA skin biopsy can also be used to confirm the diagnosis. It is especially useful if a deeper infection is suspected, or if another type of rash is being considered.\",\"\\nGood news \\u2013 there are many available treatments for ringworm! Mild cases with just a few lesions are typically treated with topical antifungals, such as ketoconazole and terbinafine creams, among others. The length of your treatment could vary, with some infections clearing fast and some requiring 6 weeks or more of therapy. You can also use diluted vinegar soaks, as vinegar has antifungal properties.\",\"\\nWhen ringworm fails to respond to creams or is widespread, affecting multiple body parts at once, your doctor may prescribe medication to be taken by mouth. For example, in tinea capitis, topical creams are ineffective, as they do not reach fungal organisms in your hair follicles. So, oral meds are needed in these cases.\",\"\\nTerbinafine, fluconazole, and griseofulvin are commonly prescribed oral medications. The choice depends on suspected organisms and emerging resistance patterns. Oral antifungal medications are known for having interactions with other medications. So, it\\u2019s important to tell your doctor about all the medications you\\u2019re taking and any prior medical problems before starting oral therapy.\",\"## [Keratosis Pilaris: What It Is and How to Treat It](https://blogs.webmd.com/skin-care/20240906/keratosis-pilaris-what-it-is-and-how-to-treat-it \\\"\\\")\\n\\nKeratosis pilaris (KP) is a very common benign skin condition characterized by numerous small red or brown bumps involving the hair follicle ....\",\"## [What Are Warts, and What Can I Do About Them?](https://blogs.webmd.com/skin-care/20240726/what-are-warts-and-what-can-i-do-about-them \\\"\\\")\\n\\nIf you polled a group of dermatologists and asked about a common skin condition that\\u2019s easy to diagnose, but difficult to treat, a few of us would groan warts ....\",\"\\nAs a physician, I often see patients searching for effective ways to manage their pain. While medications and therapies are often the focus, an increasingly important factor is emerging: the role of diet and gut health in pain management.\",\"\\nResearch is revealing a significant connection between the gut microbiome and chronic pain, suggesting that your dietary choices can greatly influence your pain experience.\",\"\\nYour gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms residing in your intestines. These microorganisms are essential for various bodily functions, including your digestion, metabolism, and immune response. A healthy microbiome helps regulate your inflammation. That\\u2019s important because chronic inflammation can be linked to pain conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\",\"\\nDr. Emeran Mayer, a leading expert on the gut-brain connection, states, \\u201cThe gut is a sensory organ and communicates with the brain, influencing our emotional and physical well-being.\\u201d This underscores the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for optimal health.\",\"\\nInflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, but when it becomes chronic, it can lead to persistent pain. Your diet plays a critical role in regulating inflammation. Foods rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber can help calm inflammation, while processed foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats can exacerbate it.\",\"\\nFor instance, a study published in the _Journal of Nutrition_ found that diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats significantly lowers inflammation markers. Dr. Andrew Weil, a pioneer in integrative medicine, emphasizes, \\u201cEating an anti-inflammatory diet can not only improve health but also reduce pain in many patients.\\\"\",\"\\n**Incorporate anti-Inflammatory foods.** Eating foods known for their anti-inflammatory properties \\u2013 such as berries, leafy greens, turmeric, and ginger \\u2013 gives you essential nutrients and helps lessen your inflammatory responses.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Choose probiotics for gut health.** Probiotics found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi can promote a healthy gut microbiome. A balanced microbiome can help reduce your systemic inflammation.\\n\\n\",\"\\n\\u201cThe gut microbiome is a key player in our health, and maintaining its balance can lead to significant improvements in conditions like chronic pain,\\u201d notes Dr. Robynne Chutkan, a gastroenterologist and microbiome expert.\",\"\\n**Stay hydrated.** Getting enough hydration is crucial for your overall health, including your gut health. Dehydration can lead to digestive issues that may lead to systemic inflammation. Aim to drink plenty of water and include hydrating foods such as cucumbers and watermelon in your diet.\\n\\n\",\"\\n**Consider elimination diets.** For some people, certain foods can trigger pain and inflammation. Common examples are gluten, dairy, and highly processed foods. With the help of your health\\u00a0care professional, an elimination diet can help identify these triggers and lead to an eating plan that lessens your pain.\\n\\n\",\"\\nMindful eating is a good way to enhance your gut-pain connection. Take time to enjoy meals, pay attention to hunger cues, and be aware of how different foods affect your body. These habits can lead to better food choices. Keep a food diary to help identify patterns between your diet and pain levels.\",\"\\nBy having a balanced, anti-inflammatory diet, you can help reduce your inflammation, support your gut health, and lessen your pain. As always, I encourage you to talk with your health\\u00a0care professional before making big changes to your diet, especially if you have chronic pain. Recognizing the powerful link between gut health and pain empowers you to take meaningful steps to enhance your overall quality of life.\",\"## [What to Know about Ketamine and Pain Management](https://blogs.webmd.com/pain-management/20240917/what-to-know-about-ketamine-and-pain-management \\\"\\\")\\n\\nWant to use ketamine for pain management?

Subcutaneous fat is just under your skin \\u2013 it\\u2019s the fat you can see. But visceral (or abdominal) fat settles around your organs and has the greatest impact on your health. A high amount of this type of fat raises your risk for diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, and other serious health problems.\",\"# BMI Calculator & Healthy Weight Plan\\n\\nAge: Body fat as a percentage of total body weight begins to go up around age 30.\",\"# BMI Calculator & Healthy Weight Plan\\n\\nSex: At the same BMI, women (or people assigned female at birth) have about 10% more body fat than men (or people assigned male at birth).\",\"# BMI Calculator & Healthy Weight Plan\\n\\nRace/ethnic group:  Different races or ethnic groups can have differences in body makeup at the same BMI.

It doesn\\u2019t measure how much of your weight is made up of muscle. A person with more muscle tissue as a percentage of body weight can have the same BMI as someone with more body fat.\",\"# BMI Calculator & Healthy Weight Plan\\n\\nPregnancy:  You shouldn\\u2019t use a BMI measurement to see if you\\u2019re at a healthy weight while you\\u2019re pregnant. Talk to your doctor about the weight range that is right for you at this time.\",\"# BMI Calculator & Healthy Weight Plan\\n\\nA BMI range tells you if you\\u2019re in a certain weight category.
